Ṣalāh: Our daily meeting with the King of Kings, our Creator and a reaffirmation of our servitude. Ṣalāh is the second pillar of Islam and the foundation around which a believer's life is built. Ṣalāh is the key to attaining success in this life in the Dunya. Whenever the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم faced any difficulty, he turned to Allah in Ṣalāh. Ṣalāh is the first thing we as Muslims will be asked about on the Day of Judgment. If something is so important for our stay in this world as well as the hereafter, then it should be of utmost importance for us to learn about it and make sure that we are doing it correctly.

Our beloved Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, commanded us to “Pray as you see me pray.” This teaches us that Allāh will accept only that prayer which is in line and in accordance to the Sunnah taught by His Messenger ﷺ. Ṣifah Ṣalāh al-Nabī (The Prophet's Prayer) is a renowned work of the late Imam and scholar of Ḥadīth, Shaykh Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī. The original work in Arabic was a unique milestone with a fresh approach in presenting the topic.

The intent behind the compilation of the book was clearly noted by the author: “Since I had not come across a comprehensive book covering this topic, I felt obliged to produce a book which collected together as many features of the Prophet’s prayer صلى الله عليه وسلم from the takbīr to the taslīm as possible, for the benefit of my Muslim brothers who wished to follow the guidance of their Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in their worship, such that it would be easy for any who truly loved the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم to use this book to fulfil his command, ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’”
