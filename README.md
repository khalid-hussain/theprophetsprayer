# About

This repository is about creating a crisp PDF copy of Shaykh Al-Albani's book, "Ṣifah Ṣalāh al-Nabī."

# To Do

I've highlight things which I would like to get back to as TODO comments in the text files. If you know the answer or verifications required, please do contact me or open an issue or send in a pull request.

## Front matter

- Add Typesetter's Note

## Main matter
- ~~Ayahs quoted as block use a different reference compared to inline quotations. Is this a problem?~~
- Add proper dua symbols for Prophets, Scholars and Companions.
  - Prophets (ʿalayh al-Salām)
  - Male
  - Female
  - Two people
  - Them
- Come up with a consistent title case
- Remove hamza transliteration if it comes at the end of a word. Example: _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl_ --> _Irwā al-Ghalīl_.
- Unify all references to Quranic chapters and verses. Clean the reference style used to mention the number of verses.
- ~~Create short titles for the Appendices since headers touch the page numbers~~

## Back matter

- ~~Quran Chapter list~~
- References to Quranic ayat which have been translated in the text

## Cover

- Use golden ratio

## Final Checks

- Ensure footnotes are correct
- Link internal sections
- Recheck internal link titles

# Questions

1. But the book is already available on the website mentioned under 'Sources'?

  **Ans:** Yes that is correct. However, the site design is quite old, still using HTML tables for layout and all the Arabic sections are poor quality images; we hope to rectify these problems.

# Dependencies

- Python 3 -- Used to solve [Pandoc Issue #1762](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1762).
- Adobe Garamond Pro (modified with diacritics) -- However, this can be changed to a different font.

# Source Used

[Qur'an and Sunnah Society of North America](http://www.qss.org/articles/salah/toc.html)
