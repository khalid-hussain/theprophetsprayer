Narrated Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo:

> A man came to Allāh's Messenger \pbuh and said, “I saw in a dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honey were dropping from it and I saw the people gathering it in their hands, some gathering much and some little. And behold, there was a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you held it and went up; then, another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) man held it and went up, and then another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got connected again.” Abū Bakr \mabpwhim said, “O Allah's Messenger! Let my father be sacrificed for you! By Allah, allow me to interpret this dream.” The Prophet \pbuh said to him, “[Interpret it]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}”. Abu Bakr \mabpwhim said, “The cloud with shade symbolizes Islam, and the butter and the honey dropping from it symbolizes the Quran, its sweetness and some people learning much of the Quran while some a little. The rope which is extended from the sky to the earth is the Truth which you (the Prophet \pbuh) are following. You follow it and Allah will raise you high with it, and then another person will follow it and will rise up with it and then another man  will follow it but it will break and then it will be connected for him and he will rise up with it. O Allāh's Messenger! Let my father be sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?” The Prophet \pbuh replied, “[You are right in some of it and wrong in some of it]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.” Abū Bakr \mabpwhim said, “O Allah's Prophet! By Allah, you must tell me in what I was wrong.” The Prophet \pbuh said, “[Do not swear]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.”
