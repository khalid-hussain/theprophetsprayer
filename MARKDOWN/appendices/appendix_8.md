From Irwā al-Ghalīl (2/178--182) by Shaykh al-Albānī

1) “The Prophet \pbuh, when he raised his hands in duʿā', he would not put them down until he had wiped his face with them.”

**Daʿīf (Weak)**. Transmitted by al-Tirmidhī (2/244) and Ibn ʿAsākir (7/12/2) via: Ḥammād ibn ʿIsā al-Juhanī from Hanzalah ibn Abī Sufyān al-Jamhī from Sālim ibn ʿAbd Allāh from his father from ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, who said:...

Al-Tirmidhī said after it, “This is a _ṣaḥīḥ gharīb ḥadīth_. We only know it as a _ḥadīth_ of Ḥammād ibn ʿĪsā, for he is alone in reporting it; he has few _aḥādīth_, but the people have reported from him.”

However, this reporter is weak, as in _al-Taqrīb_ of Ibn Ḥajr, who says about him in _al-Tahdhīb_:

> Ibn Maʿīn said, “A good _shaykh_.” Abū Hātim said, “Weak in _ḥadīth_;” Abū Dāwūd said, “Weak, he reports _munkar aḥādīth_;” al-Ḥākim and Naqqāsh said, “He reports fabricated _aḥādīth_ from Ibn Jurayj and Jaʿfar al-Sādiq.” He is declared to be weak by al-Dāraquṭnī. Ibn Ḥibbān said, “He reports things which are the wrong way round on the authority of Ibn Jurayj and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, such that it seems to those whose field this is that it is deliberate; it is not permissible to use him as proof.” Ibn Mākūlā said, “They declare his _aḥādīth_ to be weak.”

Hence, the like of this reporter is very weak, so his _aḥādīth_ cannot be raised to the level of _ḥasan_, let alone _ṣaḥīḥ_!

A similar _ḥadīth_ is:

“When the Prophet \pbuh did _duʿā_ and raised his hands, he would wipe his face with his hands.”

**Daʿīf (Weak)**. Abū Dāwūd (1492) from Ibn Lahīʿah from Ḥafṣ ibn Hishām ibn ʿUtbah ibn Abī Waqqās from Sāʾib ibn Yazīd from his father.

This is a weak _sanad_ due to Ḥafṣ ibn Hishām being unknown and the weakness of Ibn Lahīʿah (cf. _al-Taqrīb al-Tahdhīb_).

This _ḥadīth_ cannot be strengthened by the two routes of narration together due to the severity in weakness of the first one, which you have seen.

2) “When you call upon Allāh, then supplicate with the palms of your hands, and do not supplicate with their backs, and when you finish, wipe your face with them.”

**Daʿīf (Weak)**. Related by Ibn Mājah (1181, 3866), Ibn Naṣr in _Qiyām al-Layl_ (p.\ 137), al-Tabarānī in _al-Muʿjam al-Kabīr_ (3/98/1) and al-Ḥākim (1/536), from Ṣāliḥ ibn Ḥassān from Muḥammad ibn Kaʿb from Ibn ʿAbbās (May Allāh be pleased with him) as _marfūʿ_.

This is a weak _sanad_ due to Ibn Ḥassān, who is _munkar_ in _ḥadīth_, as al-Bukhārī said; al-Nasāʾī said, “He is abandoned in _ḥadīth_;” Ibn Ḥibbān said, “He used to have female singers and listen to music, and he used to narrate fabricated reports on the authority of trustworthy narrators;” Ibn Abī Hātim said in _Kitāb al-ʿIlal_ (2/351), “I asked my father (i.e. Abū Hātim al-Rāzī) about this _ḥadīth_, to which he said: ‘_Munkar_.’”

Ibn Ḥassān has been backed up by ʿĪsā ibn Maymūn, who also reported it from Muḥammad ibn Kaʿb, as related by Ibn Naṣr. However, this does not alter anything, since Ibn Maymūn is similarly weak: Ibn Ḥibbān said, “He reports _aḥādīth_, all of which are fabricated;” al-Nasāʾī said, “Not reliable.”

This _ḥadīth_ of Ibn ʿAbbās is also related by Abū Dāwūd (1485), and from him al-Bayhaqī (2/212), via: ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Muḥammad ibn Ayman from ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq from someone who narrated to him from Muḥammad ibn Kaʿb, the wording being:

“Do not cover the walls. He who looks into the letter of his brother without his permission, verily he looks into the Fire. Ask Allāh with the palms of your hands, and do not ask him with their backs, and when you finish, wipe your faces with them.”

This is a weak _sanad_: ʿAbd al-Malik is declared weak by Abū Dāwūd; it also contain the _shaykh_ of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yaʿqūb who is unnamed, and therefore unknown -- it is possible that he may be Ibn Ḥassān or Ibn Maymūn, both of whom are mentioned above.

The _ḥadīth_ is also transmitted by al-Ḥākim (4/270) via: Muḥammad ibn Muʿāwiyah, who said that Masādif ibn Ziyād al-Madīnī narrated to him that he heard it from Muḥammad ibn Kaʿb al-Qurazī. al-Dhahabī followed this up by pointing out that Ibn Muʿāwiyah was declared to be a liar by al-Dāraquṭnī, so the _ḥadīth_ is falsified.

Abū Dāwūd said about this _ḥadīth_, “This _ḥadīth_ has been narrated via more than one route on the authority of Muḥammad ibn Kaʿb; all of them are feeble.”

Raising the hands on doing _Qunūt_ for a calamity is established from the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh in his supplication against the polytheists who killed seventy reciters -- transmitted by Imām Aḥmad (3/137) and al-Tabarānī in _al-Muʿjam al-Ṣaghīr_ (p.\ 111) as the _ḥadīth_ of Anas with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. Similar is proved from ʿUmar and others in the _Qunūt_ of _Witr_ prayer. However, since wiping the face after _Duʿā al-Qunūt_ is not quoted at all from the Prophet \pbuh, nor from any of his Companions, it is an innovation without doubt.

As for wiping the face after _duʿā_ outside of prayer, there are only these two _aḥādīth_; it is not correct to say that they mutually strengthen each other to the rank of _ḥasan_, as Manāwī did, due to the severity of the weakness found in their routes of narration. This is why Imām al-Nawawī said in _al-Majmūʿ_, “It is not recommended,” endorsing Ibn ʿAbd al-Salām, who said, “Only an ignorant person does it.”

The view that wiping the face after _duʿā_  is not prescribed is strengthened by the fact that there are many authentic _aḥādīth_ about raising the hands in supplication, and in none of them is there a mention of wiping the face; this shows, Allāh willing, that it is unacceptable and not prescribed.

[If] Ibn Maʿīn speaks favorably about a narrator, whereas the rest of the scholars declare him to be weak, then the statement of Ibn Maʿīn is disregarded, the reason being that he was known for his strictness and severity in criticism: weak narrators would be very careful not to reveal their weakness before him; he would therefore pass judgment accordingly. This explains why he is alone in authenticating the narrator.
