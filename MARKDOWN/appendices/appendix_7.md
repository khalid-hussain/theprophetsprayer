# The two rakʿahs after Witr

From: _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (#1993) by Shaykh al-Albānī.

i. The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, “Make the last of your prayer at night odd (_witr_).” Related by al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

ii. Abū Salamah asked ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher about the prayer of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh. She said, “He performed thirteen _rakʿahs_ (in the night prayer): he observed eight _rakʿahs_ and would then observe _Witr_ and then observe two _rakʿahs_ sitting, and when he wanted to bow, he stood up and then bowed down, and then observed two _rakʿahs_ in between the _adhān_ and _iqāmah_ of the Dawn Prayer.” Related by Muslim.

iii. Thawbān said, “We were on a journey with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, when he said, ‘Truly, this journey is an exertion and a burden, so when each of you has prayed _Witr_, he should perform two _rakʿahs_; if he wakes up (then well and good), otherwise these two will be (the night prayer) for him.’” Related by al-Dārimī (1/374), Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (2/159/1103), and Ibn Ḥibbān (683) from various routes going back to: Ibn Wahb, who said, “Muʿāwiyah bin Ṣāliḥ narrated to me from Shurayḥ bin ʿUbayd from ʿAbd al-Raḥmān bin Jubayr bin Nufayr from his father from Thawbān, who said...”

Ibn Wahb was corroborated by ʿAbd Allāh bin Ṣāliḥ, who said, “Muʿāwi\-yah bin Ṣāliḥ narrated to us...etc.” related by al-Dāraquṭnī (p.\ 177) and al-Ṭabarānī in _al-Muʿjam al-Kabīr_ (1410). ʿAbd Allāh bin Ṣāliḥ is a _shaykh_ of al-Bukhārī, so he can be used as evidence in supporting others' narrations.

This _ḥadīth_ is used as evidence by Imam Ibn Khuzaymah, “that prayer after _Witr_ is allowed to whoever wants to pray after it, and that the two _rakʿahs_ which the Prophet \pbuh used to pray after _Witr_ were not exclusively for him over his _Ummah_, for he has ordered us to pray two _rakʿahs_ after _Witr_, an order of recommendation and preference, not one of obligation and compulsion.”

Hence, it is clear to us from this _ḥadīth_ (because of his general order to his _Ummah_) that the two _rakʿahs_ after _Witr_ were not exclusively for him; it seems that the purpose of his command to make the last prayer at night odd was to prevent neglect of the one odd _rakʿah_, so this objective is not contradicted by the two _rakʿahs_ after it, as established in his practice and his command. Allāh knows best.
