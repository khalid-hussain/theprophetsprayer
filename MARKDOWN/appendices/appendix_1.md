# A: The weakness of the narrations endorsing ikhtilāf

From: Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah wa al-Mawdooʿah (58--62) by Shaykh al-Albānī

## “The disagreement among my _Ummah_ is a mercy.” {.unnumbered}

A. **Lā Aṣla Lahu (Baseless)**. The _Muḥaddithīn_ have tried to find an _isnād_ for it but have not found one, to the extent that al-Suyūṭī said in his _al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr_, “Perhaps it was collected in one of the books of the _ḥuffāẓ_ which did not reach us”!

This suggestion is very far-fetched, since it would mean that some of the sayings of the Prophet \pbuh have been lost to the _Ummah_ forever, something which is not permissible for a Muslim to believe.

Al-Manāwī quoted al-Subkī as saying, “It (i.e. the saying) is not known to the _Muḥaddithīn_ and I cannot find any _isnād_ for it, whether _ṣaḥīḥ_, _daʿīf_ or _mawḍūʿ_,” and this was endorsed by Shaykh Zakariyyah al-Anṣārī in his notes on _Tafsīr al-Bayḍāwī_ (92/2).

Further, the meaning of this _ḥadīth_ is also incorrect as shown by the verifying scholars, hence Ibn Ḥazm says in _al-Iḥkām fī Uṣūl al-Aḥkām_ (5/64) after indicating that it is not a _ḥadīth_, “This is one of the most incorrect sayings possible, since if _ikhtilāf_ were a mercy, then agreement would be a punishment, something which no Muslim would say, because there can only be agreement or disagreement, and there can only be mercy or punishment.”

More of Ibn Ḥazm's words are quoted below.

B. **It [contradicts]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} the Qurʾān**, which has condemned _ikhtilāf_ in many places.

## “My Companions are like the stars: whichever of them you follow, you will be rightly-guided.” {.unnumbered}

**Mawḍūʿ (Fabricated)**. Related by Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr in _Jāmiʿ Bayān al-ʿIlm_ (2/91) and Ibn Ḥazm in _al-Iḥkām_ (6/82) via the route:

Sallām ibn Sulaym, who said: “Al-Ḥārith ibn Ghiṣṣīn narrated to us from al-Aʿmash from Abū Sufyān from Jābir from the Prophet \pbuh.”

Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr said, “Proof cannot be established with this _isnād_ because Al-Ḥārith ibn Ghiṣṣīn is _majhūl_ (unknown)”; Ibn Ḥazm said, “This is a fallen narration. Abū Sufyān is weak; Al-Ḥārith ibn Ghiṣṣīn is Abū Wahb al-Thaqafī; Sallām ibn Sulaymān narrated fabricated aḥādīth - this is one of them without a doubt.”

To judge this ḥadīth on Sallām ibn Sulaym---also known as Sallām ibn Sulaymān---is better, for he is agreed to be _ḍaʿīf_; in fact, Ibn Khirāsh said about him, “An utter liar” and Ibn Ḥibbān said, “He narrated fabricated aḥādīth.”

As for Abū Sufyān, he is not weak as Ibn Ḥazm said, but rather he is reliable as Ibn Ḥajar has said in _al-Taqrīb_, and Muslim narrates from him in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_.

Al-Ḥārith ibn Ghiṣṣīn is unknown as Ibn Ḥazm said, as did Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr, even though Ibn Ḥibbān does mention him in _al-Thiqāt (The Reliable Narrators)_

Hence, Aḥmad said, “This ḥadīth is not authentic,” as quoted in _al-Muntakhab_ (10/199/2) of Ibn Qudāmah.

As for the saying of Shaʿrānī in _al-Mīzān_ (1/28), “This _ḥadīth_, although debatable in the eyes of the _Muḥaddithīn_, is nevertheless authentic in the eyes of the people of _Kashf_,” it is completely false and whimsical, and is not to be given any significance! This is because authenticating _aḥādīth_ by way of _Kashf_ (“unveiling,” while in a state of trance) is a wicked innovation of the Ṣūfīs, and depending upon it leads to the authentication of false, baseless _aḥādīth_ such as this one. This is because, even at the best of times, _Kashf_ is like opinion, which is sometimes correct and sometimes wrong -- and that is if no personal desires enter into it! We ask Allāh to save us from it and from everything He is not pleased with.

<!-- TODO consider rephrasing the following paragraph-->

Similar narrations to the above are as follows:

## “The example of my Companions is that of the stars: he who follows any of them will be rightly-guided.” {.unnumbered}

**Mawḍūʿ (Fabricated)**. Related by Qudāʿī (109/2) via:

Jaʿfar ibn ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, who said: “Wahb ibn Jarīr ibn Hāzim informed us from his father from al-Aʿmash from Abū Ṣāliḥ from Abū Hurayrah from The Prophet \pbuh.”

One of the _Muḥaddithīn_, either Ibn al-Muḥibb or al-Dhahabī, wrote in the margin, “This _ḥadīth_ is not at all authentic,” i.e. it is fabricated: the flaw in it is Jaʿfar here, about whom al-Dāraquṭnī said, “He used to fabricate aḥādīth;” Abū Zurʿah said, “He narrated baseless aḥādīth”; al-Dhahabī gave some _ḥadīth_ because of which he disparaged him, among them being this one, and then said, “This is one of his calamities!”

## “Whatever you are given from the Book of Allāh is to be acted upon; there is no excuse for anyone to leave it. If it is not in the Book of Allāh, then (act upon) a previous example (_sunnah_) of mine. If there is no previous example (_sunnah_) of mine, then (act upon) what my Companions say; Verily, my Companions are of the station of the stars in the sky, so whichever of them you take, you will be guided, and the disagreement of my Companions is a mercy for you.” {.unnumbered}

**Mawḍūʿ (Fabricated)**. Collected by al-Khaṭīb in _al-Kifāyah fī ʿIlm al-Riwāyah_ (p.\ 48) and also by Abū al-ʿAbbās al-Asamm in the his _Ḥadīth_ (#142), and Ibn ʿAsākir (7/315/2) by way of:

Sulaymān ibn Abī Karīmah from Juwaybir from al-Ḍaḥḥāk from Ibn ʿAbbās from The Prophet \pbuh.

This _isnād_ is _daʿīf jiddan_ (very weak).

About Sulaymān ibn Abī Karīmah, Ibn Abī Ḥātim (2/1/138) reported from his father about him, “He is weak in _ḥadīth_.”

Juwaybir is Ibn Saʿīd al-Azadī, and is _matrūk_ (abandoned) as al-Dāraquṭnī, al-Nasāʾī and others have said, and Ibn al-Madīnī declared him to be very weak.

Al-Ḍaḥḥāk is Ibn Muzāḥim al-Hilālī, and he did not meet Ibn ʿAbbās.

Al-ʿIrāqī quoted the last part of the _ḥadīth_ in his _Takhrīj of al-Ghazzāli's Iḥyā ʿUlūm al-Dīn_ (1/25) and then said, “Its _isnād_
is _ḍaʿīf_.”

The _isnād_ is actually very weak due to what we have mentioned about Juwaybir, as al-Sakhāwī said in _al-Maqāsid_ . In meaning, however, the _ḥadīth_ is fabricated, as is clear from what has preceded and what will follow.

Al-Suyūṭī quoted the _ḥadīth_ in its entirety at the beginning of his treatise _Jazīl al-Mawāhib fī Ikhtilāf al-Madhāhib_ from the narration of al-Bayhaqī in _al-Madkhal_, and al-Daylamī related it from this route, as occurs in _al-Mawḍūʿāt_ of ʿAli al-Qārī (p.\ 19). Once you know this, then the saying of al-Suyūṭī in his aforementioned treatise is very strange: “... and this ḥadīth contains several points to note; among them his \pbuh informing of the disagreements between the _madhāhib_ in non-fundamental matters, and that is one of his miracles, since it is information about the Unseen; also, his being pleased with that and approving of it, since he described it as a mercy, and that the burdened person may choose whichever of them he wishes.”

It could be said to him: first establish the throne, and then sit. What he has mentioned about the choice is false: it is not possible for the Muslim to cling to it and act upon its generality, since it leads to breaking away from the restrictions of the Sharīʿah, as is not hard to see. See also the discussion under 2.4 below.

##  “I asked my Lord about that which my Companions would disagree about after me, so Allāh inspired me: ‘O Muhammad! Your Companions are to Me of the station of the stars in the sky -- some are brighter than others; so whoever takes from any of them in those matters where they have differed, then to Me, he is upon guidance.’” {.unnumbered}

**Mawḍūʿ (Fabricated)**. Reported by Ibn Baṭṭah in _al-Ibānah_ (4/11/2), al-Khaṭīb, Nizam al-Malik in _al-Amāli_ (13/2), al-Ḍiyā in _al-Muntaqā ʿan Masmūʿātihi bimā Rawa_ (116/2) and Ibn ʿAsākir (6/303/1) by way of:
Nuʿaym ibn Ḥammād, who said: ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn Zayd narrated to us from his father from Saʿīd ibn al-Musayyib from ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb from the Prophet \pbuh.

This _isnād_ is _mawḍūʿ_.

Nuʿaym ibn Ḥammād is weak: Ibn Hajar said, “He makes many mistakes.”

About ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ibn Zayd al-ʿAmmī, al-Bukhārī said, “He was abandoned;” Abū Ḥātim said, “His _aḥādīth_ are abandoned: he is unacceptable in _ḥadīth_ -- he used to undermine his father by narrating disasters from him;” Ibn Maʿīn said, “He was an utter, filthy liar.”

About his father, Zayd al-ʿAmmī ibn al-Hawārī, Ibn Saʿd said, “He was weak in _ḥadīth_.”

Al-Suyūṭī recorded this _hadeeth_ in _al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr_ through the narration of al-Sijīzzī in al-Ibānah and Ibn ʿAsākir from ʿUmar; al-Manāwī said in his commentary on _al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr_:

Ibn al-Jawzī said in his _al-ʿIlal_, “This is not authentic. Nuʿaym has been disparaged; Ibn Maʿīn has described ʿAbd al-Raḥīm as an utter liar; it says in _al-Mīzān_: This _ḥadīth_ is false.”

## “Verily, my Companions are like the stars: so if you accept any of their sayings, you will be guided.” {.unnumbered}

**Mawḍūʿ (Fabricated)**. Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr reports it in _muʿallaq_ (suspended, i.e. an incomplete chain of narrators at the collector's end) form and Ibn Ḥazm reports it from him; the complete chain was provided by ʿAbd ibn Ḥumayd in _al-Muntakhab min al-Musnad_ (86/1):

Aḥmad ibn Yūnus informed me: Abū Shihāb al-Ḥannāt narrated to us, from Ḥamzah al-Jazrī, from Nāfiʿ, from Ibn ʿUmar from the Prophet \pbuh.

Also, Ibn Baṭṭah narrated it in _al-Ibānah_ (4/11/2) by another chain from Abū Shihāb.

Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr said, “This _isnād_ is not authentic; no one acceptable as proof has reported it from Nāfiʿ.”

This Ḥamzah is Ibn Abī Ḥamzah; al-Dāraquṭnī said about him, “_Matrūk_ (abandoned);” Ibn ʿAdī said, “His narrations are mostly fabricated;” Ibn Ḥibbān said, “He would be alone in narrating things which are fabricated from reliable narrators, to such an extent that it is as if he did so deliberately -- it is not permissible to narrate from him;” al-Dhahabī quoted some of his fabricated _aḥādīth_ in _al-Mīzān_, this being one of them.

Ibn Ḥazm said in _al-Iḥkām_ (6/83), after declaring that this ḥadīth (#2, with all its versions) is undoubtedly a lie since it also contradicts many _āyāt_ of the Qurʾān, e.g. al-Najm (53:3--4), al-Nisā (4:82), al-Anfāl (8:46), the following:

> ...therefore, it is absurd that the Messenger \pbuh would command us to follow every view expressed by the Companions, may Allāh be pleased with them all, for there were among them those who permitted something while others prohibited it: if the above were the case, trading in intoxicants would be permissible if one followed Samurah ibn Jundub; it would be permissible for someone fasting to eat snow if one followed Abū Ṭalḥah, but prohibited by following others beside him; to not take a bath due to incomplete intercourse would be obligatory if one followed ʿAli, ʿUthmān, Ṭalḥah, Abū Ayyūb and Ubayy ibn Kaʿb, but prohibited if one followed ʿĀʾishah and Ibn ʿUmar; all these examples have been related to us with authentic chains of narration.

He then went on to explain at length some opinions expressed by Companions in which they were wrong about the Sunnah, both during the lifetime of the Prophet \pbuh and after his death. He then said (6/86),

> So how can it be allowable to blindly follow the opinions of people who make mistakes as well as get it right?!

Before that, he had explained, under the heading _Differing Condemned_ (5/64), the error of those who say, “Disagreement is a mercy,” using as evidence the _ḥadīth_, “My Companions are like the stars: whichever of them you follow, you will be rightly-guided,” by clarifying that the _ḥadīth_ is a lie for several reasons:

(i) it is not authentic with regard to its chain of narration;

(ii) further, the Prophet \pbuh could not have commanded us to follow something which he himself had declared erroneous at times; e.g. he pointed out Abū Bakr's mistake in interpreting a dream, ʿUmar's error in another interpretation, and Abū al-Sanābil's going wrong in a verdict he gave; hence, it is not possible for him to order us to follow someone mistaken;

(iii) the Prophet \pbuh never spoke falsehood; his words were always truth: the comparison with the stars is clearly flawed, since for example, if someone intends to travel a certain route directed by the stars in the constellation of Capricorn, but instead follows the stars in Cancer, he will not be correctly-guided, but will stray far away from the correct path and err tremendously; therefore, it is obviously false to say that following any star will guide one correctly.

Ibn al-Mulaqqin gave a summarized version of Ibn Ḥazm's words in his _al-Khulāṣah_ (2/175), endorsed it and ended his discussion of the _ḥadīth_ saying: Ibn Ḥazm said,“This is an invented, fabricated, false narration, not correct at all.”
