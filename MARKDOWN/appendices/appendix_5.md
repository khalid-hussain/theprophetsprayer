\chaptermark{The narrations condemning recitation behind the Imam}

From: _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah wa al-Mawḍūʿah_ (#569--570) by Shaykh al-Albānī.

_Mawḍūʿ_ ([Fabricated]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}). Ibn Ṭāhir said---after quoting it in _Tadhkirah al-Mawḍūʿāt_ (p.\ 93)---“The _isnād_ contains Maʾmūn bin Aḥmad al-Harawī, an utter liar who used to narrate fabrications.” More of his description is given in _ḥadīth_ in the following sub section. Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned this _ḥadīth_ under his name in _al-Ḍuʿafā_ (The Weak Narrators) and al-Dhahabī regarded it as one of his calamities!

Some Ḥanafīs have been deceived by this _ḥadīth_, arguing on its basis that any recitation behind the Imam is totally _ḥarām_! Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Laknawī said in _al-Taʿlīq al-Mumajjid ʿalā Muwaṭṭā Muḥammad_ (p.\ 99), “It was mentioned by the author of _al-Nihāyah_ and by others as _marfūʿ_ with the wording, ‘there is a burning coal in his mouth,’ and it is totally baseless.”

He had said before that, “In no _ṣaḥīḥ marfūʿ ḥadīth_ is there a forbiddance of reciting _al-Fātiḥah_ behind the Imam; all that they quote as _marfūʿ_ regarding this is either baseless or not authentic,” and had then mentioned this _ḥadīth_ with both wordings as an example.

The people of knowledge, both past and present, have differed regarding recitation behind the Imam, taking one of three views:

i. That recitation in loud and quiet prayers is obligatory.
ii. That silence in loud and quiet prayers is obligatory.
iii. That there be recitation in quiet, but not in loud, prayers.

This last view is the most balanced and closest to the truth, for in it, all the evidences can be accommodated such that none of them is rejected totally. It is the view of Mālik and Aḥmad, and has also been preferred after analysis by some Ḥanafīs, including Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Laknawī in his aforementioned book.

_Mawḍūʿ_ ([Fabricated]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}). Ibn Ṭāhir said---after quoting it in _Tadhkirah al-Mawḍūʿāt_ (p.\ 87)---“The _isnād_ contains Maʾmūn bin Aḥmad al-Harawī, an utter liar who used to fabricate _aḥādīth_.”

Al-Dhahabī said about him, “He brought calamities and disgraceful reports. He invented _aḥādīth_, this being one of them, and related them on the authority of reliable narrators.”

<!-- وفي " اللسان ": " وقال أبو نعيم: " خبيث وضاع، يأتي عن الثقات بالموضوعات ". -->

It is clear to me from the _aḥādīth_ which Maʾmūn al-Harawī has invented that he is a bigoted zealot of the Ḥanafī _Madhhab_, for all the _aḥādīth_ mentioned under his descriptions (in books of narrators) revolve around supporting Imam Abū Ḥanīfah and insulting Imam al-Shāfiʿī; amongst them is this one: a clear insult to the Shāfiʿī view, which approves the raising of the hands on going down into _rukūʿ_ and rising from it---which is the truth without doubt---while obviously backing the Ḥanafī view which says that this is _makrūh_. This disgusting man was not even satisfied with the position of his _Madhhab_ that raising the hands was _makrūh_: he even went to the extent of inventing this _ḥadīth_, in order to propagate amongst the people that raising the hands actually invalidates the prayer!

Perhaps he also intended to support Makḥūl's narration from Abū Ḥanīfah that he said, “He who raises his hands during prayer, his prayer is ruined,” a narration which deceived Amīr Kātib al-Itqāni, who compiled a treatise on the basis of it to argue the invalidation of the prayer by the raising of the hands! Similarly deceived was the one who trod his path and ruled that it was not permissible for Ḥanafīs to pray behind Shāfiʿīs because the latter raise their hands! While all along, this narration from Abū Ḥanīfah is utterly false, as ʿAllāmah Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Laknawī has verified it in _al-Fawāʾid al-Bahiyyah fī Tarājim al-Ḥanafīyyah_ (pp.\ 116, 216--217).

Shaykh ʿAli al-Qārī quoted this _ḥadīth_ in _al-Mawḍūʿāt_ and then said (p.\ 81), “This _ḥadīth_ was fabricated by Muḥammad bin ʿUkāshah al-Kirmānī, may Allāh disgrace him.” Later (p.\ 129), he quoted Ibn al-Qayyim as saying, “It is fabricated.”

This is contrary to what has been established (above) that the fabricator was al-Harawī; if it is proved, than perhaps one of them stole it from the other!

<!-- TODO consider revising this -->

We can see from all this what lack of heed to the Sunnah, and abandonment of verification of narrations from the Prophet \pbuh and the Imams, can do!

[Note:]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} About raising the hands on going into _rukūʿ_ and rising from it, many many _aḥādīth_ have been narrated from the Prophet \pbuh: they are actually _mutawātir_ in the eyes of the scholars; in fact, raising the hands with every _takbīr_ is proven on his authority in many _aḥādīth_; whereas not raising the hands is not authentically related from him except once via ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim, but this is not suitable for putting into practice, for it is _nafī_ (negatory). It is firmly established, in the eyes of the Ḥanafīs and others, that the _muthbit_ (affirmatory) takes precedence over the _nafī_ (negatory); this is even when the affirmatory is on its own, let alone the case when it is a multitude of narrations, as in this issue! On the basis of this principle, and in the absence of anything contrary, this renders it binding on them to adopt the raising of the hands, and not to stick zealously to the _Madhhab_ after the establishment of proof. However, it is a pity that only a handful of the earlier or later ones have adopted it, so much so that not raising the hands has become a landmark for them!

<!-- Yet another of the inventions of this vile liar, this time a personal insult to Imam al-Shāfiʿī (Muḥammad bin Idrīs), is as follows. -->

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration \#570}]
There will be a man among my \textit{Ummah} known as Muḥammad bin Idrīs, who will be more harmful to my \textit{Ummah} than Iblīs, and there will be a man among my \textit{Ummah} known as Abū Ḥanīfah, who will be the lamp of my \textit{Ummah}.

_Mawḍūʿ_ ([Fabricated]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}). Ibn al-Jawzī quoted it in _al-Mawḍūʿāt_ (1/457) via:

Maʾmūn bin Aḥmad al-Salmī, who said: Aḥmad bin ʿAbd Allāh al-Juwaybārī narrated to us: ʿAbd Allāh ibn Miʿdān al-Azadī informed us from Anas, as _marfūʿ_; and then said, “Fabricated; invented by Maʾmūn or by al-Juwaybārī.” Al-Ḥākim mentioned in _al-Madhkal_ that it was said to Maʾmūn, “Do you not look to al-Shāfiʿī and his followers?” So he said, “Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Juwaybārī narrated to us... etc. so it becomes evident that he is its fabricator.”

The following addition occurs in _Lisān_: “Al-Ḥākim then said, ‘Anyone whom Allāh has granted the least amount of intelligence would testify that a _ḥadīth_ such as this is a fabrication attributed to the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh.’”

The _ḥadīth_ does have other routes of narration, but these depend on liars and unknown reporters. Therefore, it is extremely bizarre that ʿAllāmah al-ʿAyni should incline towards strengthening the _ḥadīth_ with those other routes, and that Shaykh al-Kawtharī should support him! However, it is no surprise from the latter, for he was notorious for being submerged in zeal for Imam Abū Ḥanīfah \mabpwhim, even if it entailed insulting other Imams; but it is very surprising from al-ʿAyni, for he was generally known to not go to such extremes. The opinion of these two has been refuted, with analysis of the other routes of narration referred to, in a unique way in ʿAllāmah Yamānī's valuable book, _al-Tankīl bimā fī Taʾnīb al-Kawtharī min al-Abāṭīl_ (1/20, 446--9).
