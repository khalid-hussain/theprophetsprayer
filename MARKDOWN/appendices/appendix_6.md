\chaptermark{The saying of āmīn by the Imam and the Congregation}

From: _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (#951--#952) by Shaykh al-Albānī.

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration \#951}]
When he said \textit{āmīn}, those behind him would say \textit{āmīn}, such that there was a lot of noise in the mosque.
\end{mdframed}

There is [no basis]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"} for the _ḥadīth_ with this wording as far as we know. Ibn Ḥajr said in _al-Talkhīṣ al-Ḥabīr_ (p.\ 90), “I do not find it with this wording, but its meaning is related by Ibn Mājah in the _ḥadīth_ of Bishr bin Rāfiʿ”:

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration}]
When he recited “Not of those who received Your anger, nor of those who go astray,” he said \textit{āmīn}, such that those close to him in the first row could hear (and the mosque trembled with it).
\end{mdframed}

_Ḍaʿīf_ ([Weak]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}). Related by Ibn Mājah (1/281) and Abū Dāwūd without the addition (1/148), both via:

Bishr bin Rāfiʿ from Abū ʿAbd Allāh, cousin of Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim, from Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim from the Prophet \pbuh.

Ibn Ḥajar said in _al-Talkhīṣ_ (p.\ 90), “Bishr bin Rāfī is weak; the cousin of Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim has been said to be unknown, but Ibn Ḥibbān has declared him reliable.”

Al-Būṣayrī said in _al-Zawāʾid_ (56/1), “This is a weak _isnād_; Abū ʿAbd Allāh's condition is not known; Bishr was declared weak by Aḥmad, and Ibn Ḥibbān said, ‘He narrated fabrications.’”

This _ḥadīth_ only gives a part of the meaning of the one before it, i.e. the saying of _āmīn_ by the Imam alone. As for the _āmīn_ of those behind, this could be the reason for the phrase “the mosque trembled with it (the sound),” but the _ḥadīth_ literally implies that the _āmīn_ of the Prophet \pbuh was the reason for this.

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration}]
When he finished reciting the Mother of the Quran, he raised his voice and said \textit{āmīn}.
\end{mdframed}

_Ḍaʿīf_ ([Weak]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}). Related by al-Dāraquṭnī, al-Ḥākim, and al-Bayhaqī.

All the above sources contain Isḥāq bin Ibrāhīm bin al-ʿAlā al-Zubaydī, also known as Ibn Zibrīq, who is weak: Abū Ḥātim said, “An old man, no harm in him;” Ibn Maʿīn described him in good terms; al-Nasāʾī said, “Not reliable;” Muḥammad bin ʿAwf said, “I have no doubt that Isḥāq bin Zibrīq used to lie.” However, this wording is correct in meaning, for it has a supporting _ḥadīth_ of Wāʾil bin Ḥajar with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

<!-- TODO find a resolution for the hadith numbers that follow -->

(Since the text of this _ḥadīth_ does not imply the _āmīn_ of the congregation at all, it is incorrect to regard it as another version of _ḥadīth_ no. 2, as al-Shawkānī did.)

<!-- TODO reorganize the following to conclude sections at their end -->

<!-- TODO replace no.1 with something more recognizable or number the narrations -->

The only support for no. 1 is what al-Shāfiʿī related in his _Musnad_ (1/76) via Muslim bin Khālid from Ibn Jurayj from ʿAtā, who said:

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration}]
I used to hear the Imams: Ibn al-Zubayr and others after him would say \textit{āmīn}, and those behind would say \textit{āmīn}, until the mosque echoed.
\end{mdframed}

This has two defects:

<!-- TODO reorganize the following to conclude sections at their end -->

i. The weakness of Muslim bin Khālid al-Zanjī; Ibn Ḥajar said, “He was truthful, but made many errors.”
ii. The _ʿanʿanah_ of Ibn Jurayj, who was a _mudallis_; perhaps he actually took it from Khālid bin Abī Anūf, who narrated it from ʿAtā as follows:

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration}]
I came across two hundred Companions of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh in this mosque (i.e. Masjid al-Ḥarām, Makkah): when the Imam had said “Nor of those who go astray,” they raised their voices in \textit{āmīn} (in one narration: I heard the thundering sound of their \textit{āmīn}).
\end{mdframed}

Related by al-Bayhaqī (2/59) and Ibn Ḥibbān in _al-Thiqāt_ (2/74); the alternative narration is from the former.

This Khālid was described by Ibn Abī Ḥātim (1/2/355--366), but he did not include any authentication or disparagement. Ibn Ḥibbān included him among the reliable narrators, but Ibn Ḥibbān is well-known to be far from rigorous in such cases, so I am not satisfied that this narration is authentic. This is because if Ibn Jurayj indeed took it from him, this constitutes only one debatable route; if not, we do not know from whom Ibn Jurayj took it. It seems that Imam al-Shāfiʿī himself was not satisfied of the authenticity of this narration, for his position is contrary to it: he says in _al-Umm_ (1/95), “So when the Imam completes reciting the Mother of the Book, he says _āmīn_, raising his voice so that those behind may follow him: when he says it, they say it to themselves, but I do not like them saying it aloud;” Had the above narration from the Companions been authentic in al-Shāfiʿī's view, he would not have opposed their action.

Hence, the most correct opinion in this issue appears to be the _madhhab_ of al-Shāfiʿī: that the Imam, but not those following, should say _āmīn_ loudly. Allāh knows best.

But then, I saw that al-Bukhārī mentioned the text (only) of the narration about Ibn al-Zubayr in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (i.e. in _muʿallaq_ form), designating it with certainty. Ibn Ḥajar said in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (2/208), “The connecting _isnād_ has been provided by ʿAbd al-Razzāq from Ibn Jurayj from ʿAtā. He (i.e. Ibn Jurayj) said, ‘I said to him, “Did Ibn al-Zubayr say _āmīn_ at the end of the Mother of the Quran?” He said, “Yes, and those behind him also said _āmīn_, until the mosque echoed.” He then said, “Verily, _āmīn_ is a supplication.”’” This is found in the _Muṣannaf_ of ʿAbd al-Razzāq (2640/2), and from this route, in Ibn Ḥazm's _al-Muḥallā_ (3/364).

<!-- TODO Move Abū Rāfī to the next section -->

In this narration, Ibn Jurayj has clarified that he took the narration from ʿAtā face-to-face, so we are assured of the absence of _tadlīs_, and the narration of Ibn al-Zubayr is established firmly. Similarly is proven from Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim; Abū Rāfī said:

\begin{mdframed}[style=narration, frametitle={Narration}]
Abū Hurayrah used to call to prayer for Marwān bin al-Ḥakam, stipulating that the latter would not get to “Nor of those who go astray” unless he knew that Abū Hurayrah had entered the row. So when Marwān said “Nor of those who go astray,” Abū Hurayrah would say \textit{āmīn}, prolonging it. He also said, “When the \textit{āmīn} of those on the earth coincides with the \textit{āmīn} of those in the heaven, they are forgiven.”
\end{mdframed}

Related by al-Bayhaqī (2/59); its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_.

Hence, since nothing is established from any of the Companions other than Abū Hurayrah and Ibn al-Zubayr \mabpwthem contrary to their _āmīn_ [aloud]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}, this must be accepted. Presently, I know of no narration opposing this. Allāh knows best.
