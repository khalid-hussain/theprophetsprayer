# C: The one who prayed badly

In _ḥadīth_ and _fiqh_ literature, this term refers to the Companion mentioned in the following _ḥadīth_ of _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī_ (Book of Prayer, English translation by Dr. Muḥammad Muḥsin Khān); many other narrations of this incident are found in the various collections of _ḥadīth_, and provide an important source of instructions from the Prophet \pbuh regarding the correct way to pray:

Narrated Abu Hurayrah:

> The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man prayed and then went to the Prophet \pbuh and greeted him; he returned the greeting and said (to him), “**Go back and pray, for you have not prayed**.” The man went back and prayed in the same way as before, and then returned and greeted the Prophet \pbuh, who said, “**Go back and pray, for you have not prayed,**” three times. The man said, “By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot do so any better than this, so please teach me.” He \pbuh said, “**When you stand for the prayer, say _takbīr_ and then recite what is easy for you from the Qurʾān (from what you know by heart); then bow until you feel at ease in _rukūʿ_; then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate until you feel at ease in _sajdah_; then sit with calmness until you feel at ease, and do likewise in all your prayers.**”

Further narrations of this _ḥadīth_ found in the other works of _ḥadīth_ such as _Sunan Abī Dāwūd_, etc. contain further details.
