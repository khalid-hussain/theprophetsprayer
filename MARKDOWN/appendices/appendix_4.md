# Weakness of the narration about placing the hands below the navel

\chaptermark{The narration about placing the hands below the navel}

From _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#353) and _Aḥkām al-Janāʾiz_ (p.\ 118, al-Maktab Islāmī, 1986), both by Shaykh al-Albānī.

Imam Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal in his son, ʿAbd Allāh's _Masāʾil_ (62/2) and also in _Zawāʾid al-Musnad_ (1/110), Abū Dāwūd (756), al-Dāraquṭnī (107), al-Bayhaqi (2/310), and Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/156/1) reported:

_ʿAn_ ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq _ʿan_ Ziyād ibn Zayd al-Siwāʾī _ʿan_ Abū Juḥayfah _ʿan_ ʿAli \mabpwhim who said, “It is from the Sunnah during the prayer to place one palm on the other, below the navel.”

<!-- TODO Check _iḍṭarab_ -->

This is a _ḍaʿīf_ (weak) _sanad_ due to ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq (al-Wāsiṭī al-Kūfī), who is weak (see below). On top of that, it has _iḍṭarab_ (shakiness) in it, for he has narrated it:

i. Once _ʿan_ Ziyād _ʿan_ Abū Juḥayfah _ʿan_ ʿAlī \mabpwhim (as above);
ii. Once _ʿan_ al-Nuʿmān ibn Saʿd _ʿan_ ʿAlī (reported by al-Dāraquṭnī and al-Bayhaqī); and
iii. Once _ʿan_ Siyār Abū al-Ḥakam _ʿan_ Abū Wāʾil, who said, “Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said, ‘It is from the Sunnah...’” (reported by Abū Dāwūd [758] and al-Dāraquṭnī).

## The Weakness of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Kūfī in the eyes of the Imams of Ḥadīth {.unnumbered}

Abū Dāwūd said, “I heard Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal declaring ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Kūfī _daʿīf_ (weak).” This is why Imam Aḥmad did not accept this _ḥadīth_ of his, for his son ʿAbd Allāh said, “I saw that when praying, my father placed his hands, one on the other, above the navel.”

Al-Nawawī said in _al-Majmūʿ_ (3/313), and also in _Sharḥ Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim_ and elsewhere, “They (i.e. the scholars of _ḥadīth_) agree in declaring this _ḥadīth_ weak, because it is a narration of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Wāsiṭī, who is a _daʿīf_ (weak) narrator, as agreed upon by the Imams of _Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl_ (Authentication and Disparagement [of reporters]).”

Al-Zaylaʿī said in _Naṣb al-Rāyah_ (1/314), “Al-Bayhaqī said in _al-Maʿri\-fah_: ‘Its _isnād_ is not firm, for it is a unique narration of ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Isḥāq al-Wāsiṭī, who is _matrūk_ (abandoned).’”

Ibn Ḥajar said in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ (2/186), “It is a weak _ḥadīth_.”

What further points to its weakness is that contrary to it has been narrated on the authority of ʿAli \mabpwhim with a better _isnād_: the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn Jarīr al-Ḍabbī _ʿan_ his father, who said, “I saw ʿAli \mabpwhim holding his left arm with his right on the wrist, _above the navel_,”---this _isnād_ is a candidate for the rank of _ḥasan_; Al-Bayhaqī (1/301) firmly designated it to be _ḥasan_, and al-Bukhārī (1/301) designated it with certainty, giving it in an abridged, _taʿlīq_ form.

What is authentic from the Prophet \pbuh with respect to the position of the hands is that they should be on the chest; there are many _aḥādīth_ about this, among them is one on the authority of Ṭāwūs, who said, “The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh used to place his right arm on his left arm, and clasp them firmly on his chest during prayer,”---transmitted by Abū Dāwūd (759) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_. Although this is _mursal_, it is enough as proof for all scholars, with all their various opinions regarding the _mursal ḥadīth_, since it is _ṣaḥīḥ_ as a _mursal isnād_ and has also been related as _mawṣūl_ in many narrations; hence, it is valid as proof for all. Some of the supporting narrations are as follows:

i. From Wāʾil bin Ḥujr: “That he saw the Prophet \pbuh put his right hand upon his left and place them upon his chest.” Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (_Naṣb al-Rāyah_, 1/314) and reported by al-Bayhaqī in his _Sunan_ (2/30) with two chains of narration which support each other.

ii. From Qabīṣah bin Hulb, from his father who said: “I saw the Prophet \pbuh leave after completing the prayer from his right and his left, and I saw him place this upon his chest---Yaḥyā (Ibn Saʿīd) described the right (hand) upon the left above the joint.” Reported by Imam Aḥmad (5/226) with a chain of narrators who are of the standard set by Muslim except for Qabīṣah, but he is declared reliable by al-ʿIjlī and Ibn Ḥibbān; however, no one narrates from him except Simāk bin Ḥarb about whom Ibn al-Madīnī and al-Nasāʾī say: “Unknown,” and Ibn Ḥajar says in _al-Taqrīb_: “He is _Maqbūl_, i.e. acceptable only if supported.” The _ḥadīth_ of one such as him are _ḥasan_ as supporting narrations, and therefore al-Tirmidhī said after quoting the part of this _ḥadīth_ concerning taking the left hand with the right, “It is a _ḥasan ḥadīth_.”

So these are three _aḥādīth_ which show that the Sunnah is to place the hands on the chest, and one who comes across them will not doubt that together they are sufficient to prove this.
