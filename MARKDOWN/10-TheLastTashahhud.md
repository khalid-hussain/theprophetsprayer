# The Last Tashahhud

\minitoc

## The obligation of this _tashahhud_

Next, after completing the fourth _rakʿah_, he \pbuh would sit for the last _tashahhud_. He \pbuh would instruct regarding it, and do in it, just as he did in the first _tashahhud_, except that he would sit _mutawarrikan_,[^h249] with his left upper thigh on the ground, and both his feet protruding from one (i.e. the right) side.[^h250] He \pbuh would have his left foot under his (right) thigh and shin,[^h251] his right foot upright[^h252] or occasionally he \pbuh would lay it along the ground.[^h253] His \pbuh left palm would cover his (left) knee, leaning heavily on it.[^h254]

He set the example of sending prayers on him \pbuh in this _tashahhud_, as in the first _tashahhud_; the ways of sending prayer on him \pbuh narrated have been given in that section.

## The obligation of sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh in this _tashahhud_

Once, he \pbuh heard a man supplicating in his prayer without glorifying the majesty of Allāh Exalted, nor sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh, so he said: “This man has been hasty.” He \pbuh then called him and said to him and others, “When one of you prays, he should begin with the praise of his Lord, Almighty and Sublime, and his exaltation, and then send prayers (in one narration: he should send prayers) on the Prophet, and then supplicate as he wishes.”[^h255]

Also, he \pbuh heard a man glorifying and praising Allāh, and sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh in prayer, so the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said to him: “Supplicate, and you will be answered; ask, and you will be given.”[^h256]

## The obligation to seek refuge from four things before supplicating

He \pbuh used to say, “When one of you has finished the [last] _tashahhud_, he should seek refuge with Allāh from four things; saying:

<div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، وَمِنْ عَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ، وَمِنْ فِتْنَةِ الْمَحْيَا وَالْمَمَاتِ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ [فِتْنَةِ] الْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ.</div>
‘O Allāh! I truly seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hellfire, and from the punishment of the grave, and from the trials of living and dying, and from the evil [trials] of the False Christ.’ [Then he should supplicate for himself with what occurs to him.]”[^h257]---He \pbuh would supplicate with it in his own _tashahhud_.[^h258]

Also, he \pbuh used to teach the Companions \mabpwthem this the way he taught them _Sūrahs_ of the Quran.[^h259]

## Supplication before _taslīm_ and its various types

He \pbuh used to use different supplications in his prayer,[^h260] supplicating with different ones at different times; he also endorsed other supplications, and ordered the worshiper to select of them what he wishes.[^h261] They are:

1. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ فِتْنَةِ الْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ فِتْنَةِ الْمَحْيَا وَالْمَمَاتِ، اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْمَأْثَمِ وَالْمَغْرَمِ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Truly I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, and I seek refuge with you from the trials of the False Christ, and I seek refuge with You from the trials of living and dying. O Allāh! Truly I seek refuge with You from sin[^h262] and burden.”[^h263]^,^[^h264]

2. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا عَمِلْتُ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ مَا لَمْ أَعْمَلْ [بَعْدُ].\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Truly I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I have done, and from the evil of what I have not done[^h265][yet].”[^h266]

3. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ حَاسِبْنِي حِسَاباً يَسِيراً.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Call me to account with an easy reckoning.”[^h267]

4. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ بِعِلْمِكَ الْغَيْبَ، وَقُدْرَتِكَ عَلَى الْخَلْقِ، أَحْيِنِي مَا عَلِمْتَ الْحَيَاةَ خَيْراً لِي، وَتَوَفَّنِي إِذَا عَلِمْتَ الْوَفَاةَ خَيْراً لِي، اللّٰهُمَّ وَأَسْأَلُكَ خَشْيَتَكَ فِي الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ كَلِمَةَ الْحَقِّ (وَفِي رِوَايَة: الحُكْمِ)، والْعَدْلَ فِي الْغَضَبِ والرِّضَى، وَأَسْأَلُكَ الْقَصْدَ فِي الْفَقْرِ وَالْغِنَى، وَأَسْأَلُكَ نَعِيماً لَا يَنْفَدُ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ قُرَّةَ عَيْنٍ [لا تَنْفَذ و] لَا تَنْقَطِعُ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ الرِّضَى بَعْدَ الْقَضَاءِ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ بَرْدَ الْعَيْشِ بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ لَذَّةَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى وَجْهِكَ وَ[أَسْأَلُكَ] الشَّوْقَ إِلَى لِقَائِكَ، فِي غَيْرِ ضَرَّاءَ مُضِرَّةٍ وَلَا فِتْنَةٍ مُضِلَّةٍ، اللّٰهُمَّ زَيِّنَّا بِزِينَةِ الْإِيمَانِ وَاجْعَلْنَا هُدَاةً مُهْتَدِينَ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! [I ask you], by Your knowledge of the Unseen, and Your control over the creation: give me life as long as You know that life is best for me, and take me when death is best for me. O Allāh! I also ask of You fear of You, in secret and in open; I ask of You the word of Truth (in one narration: Wisdom) and justice in anger and in pleasure; I ask of You moderation in poverty and affluence; I ask of You joy which does not fade; I ask of You pleasure [which does not pass away, nor that] which ceases; I ask of You contentment with Your decree; I ask of You coolness of life after death; I ask of You the delight of looking towards Your Face; and [I ask of You] eagerness towards meeting You, not in harmful adversity, nor in misleading afflictions. O Allāh! Adorn us with the decoration of _Īmān_, and make us those who guide and are guided.”[^h268]

5.  He \pbuh taught Abū Bakr al-Siddīq \mabpwhim to say:

    <div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي ظُلْماً كَثِيراً وَلَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، فَاغْفِرْ لِي مَغْفِرَةً مِنْ عِنْدِكَ، وَارْحَمْنِي إِنَّك أَنْتَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ.</div>  
    “O Allāh! Indeed I have wronged myself greatly, and none can forgive sins except You, so forgive me out of Your forgiveness, and have mercy on me. Truly, You are the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”[^h269]

6.  He \pbuh instructed ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher to say:

    <div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنَ الْخَيْرِ كُلِّهِ، [عَاجِلِهِ وَآجِلِهِ]، مَا عَلِمْتُ مِنْهُ وَمَا لَمْ أَعْلَمْ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الشَّرِّ كُلِّهِ، [عَاجِلِهِ وَآجِلِهِ]، مَا عَلِمْتُ مِنْهُ وَمَا لَمْ أَعْلَمْ، وَ أَسْأَلُكَ (وَفِي رِوَايَة: اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ) الْجَنَّةَ، وَمَا قَرَّبَ إِلَيْهَا مِنْ قَوْلٍ أَوْ عَمَلٍ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ، وَمَا قَرَّبَ إِلَيْهَا مِنْ قَوْلٍ أَوْ عَمَلٍ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ (وَفِي رِوَايَة: اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ) مِنْ [الْـ]خَيْرِ مَا سَأَلَكَ عَبْدُكَ وَرَسُولُكَ [مُحَمَّدٌ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا اسْتَعَاذَكَ مِنْهُ عَبْدُكَ وَرَسُولُكَ مُحَمَّدٌ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ]، [ وَأَسْأَلُكَ] مَا قَضَيْتَ لِي مِنْ أَمْرٍ أَنْ تَجْعَلَ عَاقِبَتَهُ [لِي] رُشْداً.</div>  
    “O Allāh! Indeed I ask of You all Good, [the imminent and the far-off,] that of it which I know and that which I do not know. I seek refuge with You from all Evil, [the imminent and the far-off,] that of it which I know and that which I do not know. I ask of You (in one narration: O Allāh! Indeed I ask of You) the Garden, and whatever saying or deed which brings one near to it; I seek refuge with You from the Fire, and (from) whatever saying or deed which brings one near to it. I ask of You (in one narration: O Allāh! Indeed I ask of You) [the] good of what was asked of You by Your slave and messenger [Muḥammad; and I seek refuge with You from evil of what Your slave and messenger Muḥammad \pbuh sought refuge with You]. [I ask of You] that whatever You have decreed for me, its result [for me] be beneficial.”[^h270]

7.  He \pbuh said to a man, “What do you say during the prayer?” He replied, “I bear witness (i.e. do the _tashahhud_), then I ask Allāh for the Garden, and I seek refuge with Him from the Fire. However, by Allāh, there is no murmuring[^h271] as good as yours or that of Muʿādh.” So he \pbuh said, “Our murmuring is like yours.”[^h272]


8.  He \pbuh heard a man saying in his _tashahhud_:

    <div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ يَا اللهُ (وَ فِي رِوَايَةٍ: بِاللهِ) [اَلوَاحِدُ] الْأحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِيْ لَم يَلِدْ ولَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ، أَنْ تَغْفِرَ لِي ذُنُوبِي إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيْمُ.</div>

    “O Allāh! Indeed I ask of You, O Allāh (in one narration: by Allāh), the One, the Only, the Absolute, Who begets not and nor is He begotten, and there is none like Him, that You forgive me my sins; indeed You are the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” On this, he \pbuh said, “He has been forgiven, he has been forgiven.”[^h273]

9.  He \pbuh heard another man say in his _tashahhud_:

    <div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ بِأَنَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ، لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ [وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ] [الْمَنَّانُ]، [يَا] بَدِيعَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ، يَا ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ، يَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّومُ [إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ] [الْجَنَّةَ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ].</div>  
    “O Allāh! Indeed, I ask of You, by the fact that to You belongs all Praise; there is no (true) god except You, [You alone, You have no partners;] the Bestower of Favors; [O] Originator of the Heavens and the Earth; O One that is Full of Majesty and Honor; O Living One, O Eternal One; [Indeed I ask of You][the Garden, and I seek refuge with You from the Fire].” [So the Prophet \pbuh said to his Companions, “Do you know with what he has supplicated?” They said, “Allāh and His Messenger know best.” He said, “By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, he has supplicated Allāh with His Mighty (in one narration: Mightiest) name,[^h274] with which if He is supplicated, He answers, and with which if He is asked, He gives.”][^h275]

10. One of the last things he would say between the _tashahhud_ and the _taslīm_ would be:

    <div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي مَا قَدَّمْتُ وَمَا أَخَّرْتُ، وَمَا أَسْرَرْتُ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُ، وَمَا أَسْرَفْتُ، وَمَا أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّي، أَنْتَ الْمُقَدِّمُ، وَأَنْتَ الْمُؤَخِّرُ، لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ.</div>  
    “O Allāh! Forgive me what I have done in the past, and what I will do in the future, and what I have concealed, and what I have done openly, and what I have exceeded in, whatever You know about more know than I. You are the Bringer-Forward, and You are the Delayer, there is no (true) god except You.”[^h276]
