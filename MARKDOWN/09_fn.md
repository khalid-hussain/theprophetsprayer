[^g175]: Al-Nasāʾī (1/173) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_.

[^g176]: Al-Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd.

[^g177]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Bayhaqī with a good _sanad_.

<!-- TODO double check the following  -->

[^g178]: Al-Ṭayālisī, Aḥmad, and Ibn Abī Shaybah. About _iqʿā_, Abū ʿUbaydah and others said, “It is when a man presses his buttocks against the ground, keeps his shins upright, and leans his hands on the ground, the way a dog does.” This is different from the _iqʿā_ between _sajdahs_, which is approved in the Sunnah, as covered previously.

[^g179]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, and others. See _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#316).

[^g180]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^g181]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Nasāʾī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. It is as though the meaning is that he would not separate his elbows from his side, as Ibn al-Qayyim has elucidated in _Zād al-Maʿād_.

[^g182]: Al-Bayhaqī and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred. It is given, as well as the next one, in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#380).

[^g183]: Aḥmad and Abū Dāwūd with a good _isnād_.

[^g184]: ʿAbd al-Razzāq; ʿAbd al-Ḥaqq declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ in his _Ahkām_ (#1284---with my recension).

[^g185]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, and Ibn Khuzaymah. Al-Ḥumaydī (13/1) and Abū Yaʿlā (275/2) added with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_ on the authority of Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo: “and this is the shooting of the devil; no one will forget when he does this,” and al-Ḥumaydī raised his finger. Al-Ḥumaydī also said that Muslim bin Abī Maryam said, “A man related to me that in a church in Syria, he saw images of Prophets depicted like this,” and al-Ḥumaydī raised his finger. This is an extremely strange remark, but its _sanad_ up to “the man” is _ṣaḥīḥ_.

[^g186]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^g187]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī, Ibn al-Jārūd in _al-Muntaqā_ (208), Ibn Khuzaymah (1/86/1--2), and Ibn Ḥibbān in his _ṣaḥīḥ_ (485) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. Ibn al-Mulaqqīn also declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ (28/2), and it has a supporting narration in Ibn ʿAdī (287/1).

[^g188]: Ibid. About “supplicating with it,” Imam al-Ṭaḥāwī said, “This is evidence that it was at the end of the prayer.” Hence, there is evidence in this that the Sunnah is to continue pointing and moving the finger until the _taslīm_, for the supplication is until then. This is the view of Mālik and others. Imam Aḥmad was asked, “Should a man point with his finger during prayer?” He replied, “Yes, vigorously.” (Mentioned by Ibn Hānī in his _Masāʾil al-Imām Aḥmad_, 1/80). From this, it is clear that moving the finger in _tashahhud_ is a proven _sunnah_ of the Prophet \pbuh, and it was practiced by Aḥmad and other Imams of the Sunnah. Therefore, those who think that it is pointless and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the prayer, should fear Allāh, since because of this, they do not move their fingers although they know it to be an established _sunnah_; and they take great pains to interpret it in a way which is inconsistent with the Arabic way of expression and contrary to the understanding of the Imams with regard to it.

    The amazing thing is that some of them will defend an Imam on other issues, even if his opinion conflicts with the Sunnah, with the argument that to point out the Imam's mistakes inevitably means to taunt and disrespect him. They then forget this and reject this established _sunnah_, at the same time mocking at those who practice it. Whether or not they realize it, their mockery also includes those Imams whom they often defend wrongly, and who are correct about the Sunnah this time! In fact, they are deriding the Prophet \pbuh himself, for he is the one who brought us this _sunnah_, and so jeering at it is equivalent to jeering at him. «But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this except...» (Quran, 2:85).

    As for putting the finger down after pointing, or limiting the movement to the affirmation (saying _lā ilāha_: “there is no god...”) and negation (saying: _illallāhu_: “...except Allāh”), all of that has no basis in the Sunnah; in fact, it is contrary to the Sunnah, as this _ḥadīth_ proves.

    Further, the _ḥadīth_ that he would not move his finger does not have an authentic _isnād_, as I have explained in _Ḍaʿīf Abī  Dāwūd_ (175). Even if it were authentic, it is negatory, while the _ḥadīth_ above is affirmatory: the affirmatory takes precedence over the negatory, as is well-known among the scholars.

[^g189]: Aḥmad, al-Bazzār, Abū Jaʿfar al-Bukhtīrī in _al-Amālī_ (60/1), ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Maqdisī in his _Sunan_ (12/2) with a _ḥasan sanad_, al-Rūyānī in his _Musnad_ (249/2), and al-Bayhaqī.

[^g190]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (2/123/2) with a _ḥasan sanad_.

[^g191]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/40/1, 2/123/2) and al-Nasāʾī. It was declared _ṣaḥīḥ_ by Al-Ḥākim and al-Dhahabī concurred. There is a supporting narration for it in Ibn Abī Shaybah.

[^g192]: Al-Nasāʾī and al-Bayhaqī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g193]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^g194]: Al-Bayhaqī transmitted it as a narration from ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher with a good _isnād_, as verified by Ibn al-Mulaqqīn (28/2).

[^g195]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim. It is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#338).

[^g196]: Al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, and al-Ṭabarānī in _Muʿjam al-Kabīr_ (3/25/1) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. The literal meaning of the _ḥadīth_ is evidence for the validity of supplication in every _tashahhud_, even the one not adjacent to the _taslīm_, and this is the view of Ibn Ḥazm.

[^g197]: Al-Nasāʾī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g198]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^g199]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred.

[^g200]: Arabic _taḥiyyāt_: i.e. “all words which imply peace, sovereignty, and eternity, are due to Allāh.” (_Nihāyah_)

[^g201]: Arabic _ṣalawāt_: i.e. “all supplications which are used to glorify the majesty of Allāh, for He is fully entitled to them, and none but Him is worthy of them.” (_Nihāyah_)

[^g202]: Arabic _ṭayyibāt_: i.e. “all good and pure words suitable for praising Allāh, not those ones incompatible with his attributes with which kings were greeted.” (_Fatḥ al-Bārī_)

[^g203]: Meaning, seeking of refuge with Allāh and being strengthened by him, since _al-Salām_ (Peace) is actually a name of Allāh. Hence, the greeting effectively means: “Allāh be a watcher and safeguard over you.” Similarly, it is said, “Allāh be with you,” i.e. in His safeguarding, help, and favor.

[^g204]: A term for all the good continuously emanating from Allāh.

[^g205]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Ibn Abī Shaybah (1/90/2), al-Sirāj, and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (258/2). It is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#321).

    Ibn Masūd's \mabpwhim statement, “We said: Peace be on the Prophet” clarifies that the Companions used to say, “Peace be on you, O Prophet,” in _tashahhud_ while the Prophet \pbuh was alive, but when he died, they ceased to do that, instead saying, “Peace be on the Prophet.” Undoubtedly, this was with the endorsement of the Prophet \pbuh; this is supported by the fact that ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher would similarly teach the _tashahhud_ in prayer with “Peace be on the Prophet,” as transmitted by al-Sirāj in his _Musnad_ (9/1/2) and al-Mukhliṣ in _al-Fawāʾiḍ_ (11/54/1) with two _ṣaḥīḥ isnāds_ from her.

    Ibn Ḥajar says, “This addition shows clearly that they used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet,’ addressing him directly during his life, but when the Prophet \pbuh died, they stopped addressing him and mentioned him in the third person instead, saying ‘Peace be on the Prophet.’” He also says in a different place, “Al-Subkī said in _Sharḥ al-Minhāj_, after mentioning this narration from Abū ʿAwānah only, ‘If this is authentically-reported from the Companions, it proves that after his time, it is not compulsory to address the Prophet \pbuh directly in the greeting of peace, so one says: “Peace be on the Prophet.”’” Ibn Ḥajar continues: “This is authentic without doubt (i.e. because it is established in _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī_), and I have also found strong support for it: ʿAbd al-Razzāq said: Ibn Jurayj informed me: ʿAtā informed me that the Companions used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet’ while the Prophet \pbuh was alive, but after he died, they would say ‘Peace be on the Prophet,’ and this is a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_. As for Saʿīd bin Manṣūr's narration from Abū ʿUbaydah bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd, who reported from his father that the Prophet \pbuh taught them the _tashahhud_, and then he (ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd \mabpwhim) said it (the \textit{tashahhud}\kern 0.9pt); Ibn ʿAbbās said: We used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet’ only while he was alive, to which Ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim replied, ‘This is how we were taught, and this is how we teach it,’ it would appear that Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo said this as a matter of discussion but Ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim did not accept. However, the narration of Abū Maʿmar (i.e. the narration of al-Bukhārī) is more authentic, since Abū ʿUbaydah did not hear (_aḥādīth_) from his father, and furthermore, the _isnād_ up to Abū ʿUbaydah is weak.”

    These words of Ibn Ḥajar have been quoted by several scholars in their analysis, e.g. al-Qasṭalānī, al-Zarqānī, al-Laknawī, etc. They all chose to give his words without commenting further. This discussion is treated comprehensively in _al-Aṣl_.

[^g206]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, al-Shāfiʿī, and al-Nasāʾī.

[^g207]: See next note.

[^g208]: These two additions have been proved to be part of the _tashahhud_ from the Prophet \pbuh. Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo did not add them of his own accord (far is he above such a thing!); in fact, he learned them from other Companions who reported them from the Prophet \pbuh, and he then added them to the _tashahhud_ which he heard from the Prophet \pbuh directly.

[^g209]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Dāraquṭnī who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_.

[^g210]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, Abū Dāwūd, and Ibn Mājah.

[^g211]: Mālik and al-Bayhaqī with _ṣaḥīḥ isnāds_. Although this _ḥadīth_ is _mawqūf_, it is effectively _marfūʿ_, for it is known that this sort of thing is not said from personal opinion, since it were so, it would be no better than any other sayings of _dhikr_, as Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr has said.

    [Note]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: In none of the types of _tashahhud_ is there the addition: _wa maghfiratuhu_ (“...and His forgiveness”), so one should not be accustomed to it. Hence some of the _Salaf_ rebuked it, as the following narrations show:

    It is reported from Ṭalḥah bin Muṣarrif who said: Rabīʿ bin Khaytham added during _tashahhud_, “...and His blessings, and His forgiveness”! So ʿAlqamah said, “We stop where we were taught: ‘Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings;’” ʿAlqamah was actually following the example of his teacher ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd \mabpwhim, from whom it is authentically reported that he was teaching a man the _tashahhud_: when he got to “I bear witness that there is no (true) god except Allāh...,” the man said: “alone, He has no partner,” to which ʿAbd Allāh \mabpwhim said, “He is so, but we stop at where we were taught.” Transmitted by al-Ṭabarānī in _Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ_ (#2848, 3/56/1) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_.

[^g212]: Abū ʿAwānah in his _ṣaḥīḥ_ (2/324) and al-Nasāʾī.

[^g213]: They had said, “O Messenger of Allāh, we have been taught how to send peace on you (i.e. in \textit{tashahhud}\kern 0.9pt), but how do we send prayers on you?” He said, “Say: O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad...etc.” Thus he did not specify one _tashahhud_ to the exclusion of another, so there is evidence here to establish sending prayers on him in the first _tashahhud_ also. This is the way of Imam al-Shāfiʿī, as in his book _al-Umm_, and it is held to be correct by his companions, as al-Nawawī has explained in _al-Majmūʿ_ (3/460) and supported in _Rawḍah al-Ṭālibīn_ (1/263). It is also the view of al-Wazīr bin Hubayrah al-Ḥanbalī in _al-Ifṣāḥ_, as Ibn Rajab has quoted and strongly supported in _Dhayl al-Ṭabaqāt_ (1/280). Many _aḥādīth_ exist about sending prayers on him \pbuh in _tashahhud_; in none of them is there any such specification mentioned. In fact, these _aḥādīth_ are general, hence including every _tashahhud_, and I have given them in _al-Aṣl_ as _taʿlīq_, but not in the main text, for they do not satisfy our conditions for authenticity. However, they do support each other in meaning, and those who reject and oppose this have no authentic evidence to use as proof, as I have detailed in _al-Aṣl_. Similarly, to say that adding anything to “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad” is _makrūh_ has no basis in the Sunnah, nor is there any convincing proof for it. In fact, we see that whoever says this does not implement the previous instruction of the Prophet \pbuh, “Say: O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad...;” there is more to this discussion in _al-Aṣl_.

[^g214]: One of the earliest views about the meaning of “sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh” is that of Abū al-ʿĀliyah (with reference to Sūrah al-Aḥzāb, 33:56): “Allāh's sending prayers on his Prophet means His exalting him and raising his rank; the Angels and others sending prayers means their seeking this from Allāh, and here it is meant asking the prayers to be increased, not asking for the original prayer in itself.”

    Ibn Ḥajar quoted this in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_, and went on to refute the widespread notion that the Lord's prayer on someone is His Mercy; Ibn al-Qayyim also clarified this in \textit{Jalā al-Af\kern 0.9pthām}, leaving little scope for further comment.

[^g215]: From _barakah_: growth, increase. Hence this supplication secures for Muḥammad the good which Allāh granted to the family of Ibrāhīm, continual, established good, as well as its multiplication and increase.

[^g216]: Aḥmad and al-Ṭaḥāwī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g217]: See next note.

[^g218]: These two additions are conclusively found in al-Bukhārī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, al-Bayhaqī, Aḥmad, and al-Nasāʾī. They also exist via different routes of narration in other types of this supplication (see #3 and #7), and so do not be confused by Ibn al-Qayyim's view in \textit{Jalā al-Af\kern 0.9pthām} (p.\ 198), following in the footsteps of his great teacher Ibn Taymīyyah in _al-Fatāwā_ (1/16), “There is no authentic _ḥadīth_ with the phrases ‘Ibrāhīm’ and ‘the family of Ibrāhīm’ together;” here, we have shown you such authentic _aḥādīth_. Ibn al-Qayyim's error is further established by the fact that he himself declared #7 _ṣaḥīḥ_, which contains what he denied above!

[^g219]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, al-Ḥumaydī (138/1), and Ibn Mandah (68/2) who said, “There is consensus on this _ḥadīth_ being authentic.”

[^g220]: Aḥmad, al-Nasāʾī, and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (44/2) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g221]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, Ibn Abī Shaybah (2/132/1), and Abū Dāwūd; Al-Ḥākim declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_.

[^g222]: Al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāʾī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, Aḥmad, and Ismāʿīl al-Qāḍī in _Faḍl al-Ṣalāh ʿalā Nabī \pbuh_ (p.\ 28, 1^st^\ ed.; p.\ 62, 2^nd^\ ed.---with my checking).

[^g223]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and al-Nasāʾī.

[^g224]: Al-Nasāʾī, al-Ṭaḥāwī, Abū Saʿīd bin al-ʿArabī in _al-Muʿjam_ (79/2) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. Ibn al-Qayyim gave its source as Muḥammad bin Isḥāq al-Sirāj in \textit{Jalā al-Af\kern 0.9pthām} (pp.\ 14--15) and then declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_. This wording includes both ‘Ibrāhīm’ and ‘the family of Ibrāhīm,’ something overlooked by both Ibn al-Qayyim and his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah, as explained above.

[^g225]: Abū Dāwūd and Aḥmad with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_.

[^g226]: A famous grammarian and scholar of the Arabic language of the second century [ah]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.

[^g227]: Preserved in the Ẓāhiriyyah Library in Damascus.

[^g228]: Al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, and al-Ṭabarānī with various _isnāds_ from Ibn Mas\-ʿūd \mabpwhim. Details are given in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (#878). There is also the supporting _ḥadīth_ of Ibn al-Zubayr, found in _Majmaʿ al-Zawāʾid_ (2/142).

[^g229]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^g230]: Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (284/2) with a good _isnād_. It is given in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (#604).

[^g231]: Al-Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd.

[^g232]: Ibid.

[^g233]: Abū ʿAwānah and al-Nasāʾī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g234]: literally, “as one who kneads dough.”

[^g235]: Al-Ḥarbī in _Gharīb al-Ḥadīth_; its meaning is found in al-Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd. As for the _ḥadīth_, “he forbade that a man should support himself with his hand when getting up during prayer,” it is _munkar_ and not authentic, as I have explained in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (#967).

[^g236]: Arabic _Qunūt_: carries several meanings, e.g. humility, devotion. In this context, it refers to the special supplication while standing during prayer.

[^g237]: Al-Bukhārī and Aḥmad.

[^g238]: Ibid.

[^g239]: Aḥmad and al-Ṭabarānī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. To raise the hands in _qunūt_ is the _madhhab_ of Imam Aḥmad and also Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh. See al-Marwazī's _Masāʾil_ (p.\ 23). As for wiping the face with the hands, it is not reported in this position, and is thus an innovation; as for outside of prayer, it is not authentically reported. All that has been transmitted in this regard is either weak or very weak, as I have shown in _Ḍaʿīf Abī Dāwūd_ (#262) and _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (#597). This is why al-ʿIzz bin ʿAbd al-Salām said in one of his fatwas, “Only an ignorant person does it.” See \hyperref[the-weakness-of-narrations-mentioning-wiping-the-face-with-hands-after-duux2bfux101]{\textit{Appendix H}}.

[^g240]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Sirāj; Al-Ḥākim declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī and others concurred.

[^g241]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Sirāj, and al-Dāraquṭnī with two _ḥasan sanads_.

[^g242]: Ibn Khuzaymah in his _ṣaḥīḥ_ (1/78/2) and al-Khaṭīb in _Kitāb al-Qunūt_ with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g243]: Al-Bukhārī and Aḥmad; the addition is in Muslim.

[^g244]: Al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, al-Sirāj (109/1), and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ with a good _sanad_.

[^g245]: Ibn Naṣr and al-Dāraquṭnī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^g246]: We have said, “...sometimes” because the Companions who narrated the _Witr_ prayer did not mention the _qunūt_ in it, whereas had the Prophet \pbuh done so always, they would have all mentioned it. However, Ubayy ibn Kaʿb alone narrated the _qunūt_ in _Witr_, so this shows that he used to do it sometimes. Hence, this is evidence that _qunūt_ in _Witr_ is not obligatory (_wājib_), and this is the opinion of the majority of scholars. For this reason, the researching Ḥanafī scholar, Ibn al-Humām, recognized in _Fatḥ al-Qadīr_ (1/306, 359, 360) that the view of it being obligatory is feeble and not substantiated by evidence. This shows his fairness and lack of party-spirit, for this view which he has supported is contrary to his _madhhab_!

[^g247]: Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/41/1), Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī in _Sunan al-Kubrāʾ_ (218/1--2), Ibn ʿAsākir (4/244/2), Aḥmad, al-Ṭabarānī, and al-Bayha\-qī narrated this, along with the supplication after it, with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. Ibn Mandah narrated the supplication only in _Tawḥīd_ (70/2) with a different, _ḥasan sanad_. Its _takhrīj_ is also given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#426).

[^g248]: Ibn Khuzaymah (1/119/2) and also Ibn Abī Shaybah etc. as for the previous _ḥadīth_.

    [Note]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: Al-Nasāʾī adds at the end of the _qunūt_: _wa sall-Allāhu ʿalā al-Nabīyy al-Ummīyy_ (“may Allāh send prayers on the Unlettered Prophet”), related with a weak _isnād_; among those who declared it _ḍaʿīf_ are Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī and al-Zurqānī. Therefore, we have not included it in our system of combining acceptable narrations. Al-ʿIzz bin ʿAbd al-Salām said in _al-Fatāwā_ (66/1, 1962), “To send prayers on the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh in _qunūt_ is not authentic, nor is it fitting to add to the Messenger of Allāh's \pbuh prayer in any way.” This view of his shows that he did not widen the argument by including the idea of _bidʿah ḥasanah_ (good innovation), as some of the later scholars are prone to doing!

    However, it is proved in the _ḥadīth_ about Ubayy bin Kaʿb leading the people during the Ramadan night prayers that he used to send prayers on the Prophet \pbuh at the end of the _qunūt_, and that was during the reign of ʿUmar \mabpwhim---transmitted by Ibn Khuzaymah in his _Ṣaḥīḥ_ (1097). Similarly is proved from Abū Ḥalīmah Muʿādh al-Anṣārī, who also used to lead them during ʿUmar's \mabpwhim rule---transmitted by Ismāʿīl al--Qāḍī (#107) and others, so this addition is justified by the practice of the _Salaf_, and it is thus not fitting to categorically state that this addition is an innovation. Allāh knows best.
