[^h249]: Al-Bukhārī.

[^h250]: Ibid. As for two _rakʿah_ prayers such as Fajr, the Sunnah is to sit _muftarishan_. This difference in detail is documented from Imam Aḥmad, see Ibn Hānī's _Masāʾil al-Imām Aḥmad_ (p.\ 79).

[^h255]: Aḥmad, Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Khuzaymah (1/83/2), and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred.

    It should be known that this _ḥadīth_ proves that _ṣalāh_ (sending prayers) on the Prophet \pbuh in this _tashahhud_ is obligatory, due to the command about it. This opinion was taken by Imam al-Shāfiʿī and by Imam Aḥmad in the later of the two narrations from him, and before them by several Companions, as well as other people of knowledge. Because of this, al-Ājurrī said in _al-Sharīʿah_ (p.\ 415): “He who does not send prayers on the Prophet \pbuh in the final _tashahhud_ must repeat the prayer.” Hence, those who label Imam al-Shāfiʿī as being alone and odd in his opinion on this, are not being just, as the _faqīh_ al-Haythamī has explained in _al-Darr al-Manḍūd_ (§§ 13--16).

[^h256]: Al-Nasāʾī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^h257]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, al-Nasāʾī, and Ibn al-Jārūd in _al-Muntaqā_ (27). It is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#350).

[^h258]: Abū Dāwūd and Aḥmad with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^h259]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.

[^h260]: We have not said, “...in his _tashahhud”_ because the text is “...in his prayer,” not specifying either _tashahhud_ or anything else. Hence, it covers all positions suitable for supplication, e.g. prostration and _tashahhud_; the instruction to supplicate in these two postures has been mentioned.

[^h261]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim. Al-Athram asked Imam Aḥmad: “With what (words) should I supplicate after _tashahhud_?” He replied, “As has been narrated.” Al-Athram said, “Didn't the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh say, ‘Then he should select whichever supplication he likes’?” Imam Aḥmad said, “He should select out of what has been narrated.” Al-Athram repeated the question to which Imam Aḥmad replied, “From what has been narrated.” This was quoted by Ibn Taymīyyah (_Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā_ 69/218/1), who endorsed it, adding, “Hence, ‘whichever supplication’ refers to the supplications which Allāh loves, not to any supplication...;” later he said, “Hence, it is best to say: (one should supplicate) with the approved, established supplications, and these are what have been narrated and those that are beneficial.” This is so, but to recognize which supplications are indeed beneficial depends on authentic knowledge, and this is rarely found among the people, so it is best to stick to the supplications quoted, especially when they include what the worshiper wishes to request. Allāh knows best.

[^h262]: Arabic _al-Maʾtham_: what causes a man to sin, or the sin itself.

[^h263]: Arabic _al-Maghram_: burden; here it means debt, as proved by the rest of the _ḥadīth_, in which ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher said, “Someone said to him, ‘Why do you seek refuge from _maghram_, so often, O Messenger of Allāh?’ He replied, ‘Truly, when a man becomes indebted, he speaks and lies, and he promises and breaks his promise.’”

[^h264]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^h265]: i.e. from the evil of the bad actions I have done, and from the evil of not doing good actions.

[^h266]: Al-Nasāʾī with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_ and Ibn Abī ʿĀṣim in his _al-Sunnah_ (#370---with my checking); the addition is from the latter.

[^h267]: Aḥmad and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī agreed.

[^h268]: Al-Nasāʾī and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred.

[^h269]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^h270]: Aḥmad, al-Ṭayālīsī, al-Bukhārī in _al-Adab al-Mufrad_, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ḥākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred. I have given its _takhrīj_ in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (#1542).

[^h271]: Arabic _dandanah_: to speak such that the intonation is audible, but the words are incomprehensible---in this case, the quiet words of supplication. The final statement means, “Our words are like yours.”

[^h272]: Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah, and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/87/1) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_.

[^h273]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, and Ibn Khuzaymah; Al-Ḥākim declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred.

[^h274]: This is _tawassul_ (a seeking of approach) to Allāh through His most beautiful names and attributes, and this is what Allāh the Exalted commands: «To Allāh belong the most beautiful names, so call on Him by them.» (Quran, 7:180). As for seeking to approach Allāh through other things, e.g. for so-and-so's sake, or by so-and-so's right, status, dignity, etc. there is text from Iaām Abū Ḥanīfah and his companions that such a practice is at least disliked (_makrūh_); in general it is prohibited (_ḥarām_). Therefore, it is a pity that one sees most of the people, among them many _shaykhs_, totally neglecting the approved _tawassul_---you will never hear them approaching Allāh this way---but they are well-versed in innovated forms of _tawassul_, which are at the very least debatable, as though no other way is allowed! Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah has composed an extremely good essay on this subject entitled _al-Tawassul wa al-Wasīlah (Approaching Allāh, and the Means of doing so)_, which should be consulted, for it is very important, and there is little to compare with it in its coverage. There is also my article _al-Tawassul--Its types and its rulings_, which is also important in its subject matter and format, and also refutes some of the latest misconceptions advanced by contemporary doctors of religion. May Allāh guide us and them.

[^h275]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, al-Bukhārī in _al-Adab al-Mufrad_, al-Ṭabarānī, and Ibn Mandah in _Tawḥīd_ (44/2, 67/1, 70/1--2) with _ṣaḥīḥ isnāds_.

[^h276]: Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah.
