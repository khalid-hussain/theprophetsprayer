[^i277]: Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasāʾī, and al-Tirmidhī who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_.

[^i278]: Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/87/2) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_. ʿAbd al-Ḥaqq also declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ in his _Aḥkām_ (56/2), as did al-Nawawī and Ibn Ḥajar. It was also transmitted via another route by ʿAbd al-Razzāq in his _Muṣannaf_ (2/219), Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (3/1253), al-Dāraquṭnī, and al-Ṭabarānī in _Muʿjam al-Kabīr_ (3/67/2) and _Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ_ (#4476---my numbering).

[^i279]: Al-Nasāʾī, Aḥmad, and al-Sirāj with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_.

[^i280]: Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Bayhaqī, al-Ḍiyā in _al-Mukhtārah_, and ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Maqdisī in his _Sunan_ (243/1) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_; Aḥmad, al-Ṭabarānī in _Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ_ (32/2), al-Bayhaqī, Ibn al-Mulaqqīn (29/1), and al-Hākim who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred. Its _takhrīj_ is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ under _ḥadīth_ #327.

[^i281]: Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, al-Sirāj, Ibn Khuzaymah, and al-Ṭabarānī.

    [Note]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}: The ʿIbāḍīyyah have distorted this _ḥadīth_. Their scholar Rabīʿ has related it in his unreliable _Musnad_ with a different wording to justify their view that raising the hands with _takbīr_ invalidates the prayer! That wording is false, as I have explained in _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (#6044).

[^i282]: Al-Ḥākim and al-Dhahabī declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_; it has already been given in full under the \hyperref[intention-and-opening-takbux12br]{\textit{Opening Takbīr}}.

[^i283]: The first supplication is the fullest form of the _duʿā_ known as _kaffārah al-majlis_ (expiation of the gathering); “he who says it in a gathering of Remembrance (of Allāh), it will be like a seal to stamp it with, and he who says it in a gathering of vain talk, it will be an expiation for it”---authentically related by al-Ḥākim and al-Ṭabarānī. The second supplication is, of course, from the Sunnah of sending peace and mercy on the Messenger. These two supplications are thus the best way of implementing the following Islamic guideline: “No people sit in a gathering in which they do not mention Allāh, nor send prayers on the Prophet, without it being a source of regret for them; if Allāh wishes, He will punish them, or if He wishes, he will forgive them”---authentically related by al-Tirmidhī, al-Ḥākim, and Aḥmad. See Shaykh al-Albānī's _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah_ (74--81) for details.
