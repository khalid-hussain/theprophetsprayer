[^98]: Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/110/2). It is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#8).

[^99]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Ḥākim, who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred.

[^100]: It is thus in most of the narrations; in some, it is _wa ana min al-muslimīn_ (“I am one of the Muslims”). It is likely that this is because of the mistake of one of the narrators, and other evidence points to that, so the worshiper should say: _wa ana awwal al-muslimīn_ (“I am the first of the Muslims”). There is nothing wrong with that, contrary to what some people say under the impression that this means “I am the first person who has this quality, while the rest of the people do not.” But it is not so; this phrase actually represents competing to fulfill orders---similar to this is «Say: if the Merciful God has a son, then I am the first of the worshipers» (Sūrah al-Zukhruf, 43:81) and the saying of Mūsā, «...and I am the first of the believers.» (Sūrah al-Aʿrāf, 7:143)

[^101]: Al-Azharī said: i.e. “I do not worship anything other than You.”

[^102]: Arabic _labbayk_: “I am firmly and continually present in Your obedience;”

    Arabic _saʿdayk_: “extremely happy under Your order and devoutly following the _Dīn_ which You have chosen.”

[^103]: i.e. Evil cannot be traced back to Allāh because there is nothing bad in His actions, for they are all good, ranging from justice to grace to wisdom, all of which are good with no bad in them. But Evil is evil because it cannot be traced back to Allāh. Ibn al-Qayyim said: “He is the Creator of good and evil, but the evil exists in some of His creatures, not in His act of creating nor in His actions. Hence the Exalted is cleared of any _ẓulm_, which is fundamentally to put something in other than its proper place. He does not put anything except in its suitable place, so that is all good. But Evil is to put something in other than its proper place: when it is put in its proper place it is not evil, so be sure that Evil is not from Him. ...But if it is said: ‘Why did He create something which is evil?’ I would say: ‘He did the creating, and His action is good not evil, for creation and action is with Allāh, and it is impossible for Evil to be with, or attributed to, Allāh. Anything evil in the created cannot be traced back to Allāh, but His actions and His creation can be attributed to Him, so they are good.’” The rest of this important discussion as well as its conclusion is to be found in his book, _Shifā al-ʿAlīl fī Masāʾil al-Qadā wa al-Qadr wa al-Taʿlīl_ (pp.\ 178--206).

[^111]: Abū Dāwūd and al-Ḥākim, who declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ and al-Dhahabī concurred. Al-ʿUqaylī said (p.\ 103): “this has been narrated via several routes with good _isnāds_.” It is given in _Irwā al-Ghalīl_ (#341), transmitted by Ibn Mandah in _al-Tawḥīd_ (123/2) with a _ṣaḥīḥ isnād_ and al-Nasāʾī in _al-Yawm wa al-Laylah_ as _mawqūf_ and _marfūʿ_, as in _Jāmiʿ al-Masānīd_ of Ibn Kathīr (vol.\ 3, pt.\ 2, p.\ 235/2) [Typesetter's Note: The reference to _Jāmiʿ al-Masānīd_ is regarding a manuscript edition and thus may not correspond with printed editions].
