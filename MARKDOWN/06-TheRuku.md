# The Rukūʿ

\minitoc

After completing his recitation, he \pbuh would pause for a moment,[^d21] then raise his hands[^d22] in the way described earlier under the \hyperref[intention-and-opening-takbux12br]{\textit{Opening Takbīr}}, say _takbīr_,[^d23] and make _rukūʿ_.[^d24]

He also ordered _the one who prayed badly_ likewise, saying to him, “Indeed, the prayer of one of you is not complete until he makes an excellent ablution as Allāh has commanded him to...then he celebrates Allāh's greatness, praises and glorifies Him, then recites the Quran as much as is easy for him from what Allāh has taught him and allowed him, then says _takbīr_ and makes _rukūʿ_ [and places his hands on his knees] until his joints are at ease and relaxed.”[^d25]

## The _rukūʿ_ described

He \pbuh would place his palms on his knees,[^d26] and would order them to do likewise,[^d27] as he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ in the aforementioned _ḥadīth_.

He \pbuh would put his hands firmly on his knees [as though he were grasping them],[^d28] and would space his fingers out,[^d29] ordering _the one who prayed badly_ likewise, saying: “When you make _rukūʿ_, place your palms on your knees, then space your fingers out, then remain (like that) until every limb takes its (proper) place.”[^d30]

He \pbuh used to spread himself (i.e. not be in a compact position), and keep his elbows away from his sides.[^d31]

When he \pbuh made _rukūʿ_, he would spread his back and make it level,[^d32] such that if water were poured on it, it (the water) would stay there (i.e. not run off\kern 0.15em).[^d33] He \pbuh also said to _the one who prayed badly_, “When you make _rukūʿ_, put your palms on your knees, spread your back (flat) and hold firm in your rukūʿ.”[^d34]

He \pbuh would neither let his head droop nor raise it (i.e. higher than his back),[^d35] but it would be in between.[^d36]

## The obligation of being at ease in _rukūʿ_

He \pbuh used to be at ease in his _rukūʿ_, and ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to be so, as has been mentioned in the first section on _rukūʿ_.

He \pbuh used to say, “Complete the _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_, for by Him in whose Hand is my soul, I surely see you behind my back[^d37] when you make _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_.”[^d38]

He \pbuh saw a man praying not completing his _rukūʿ_ properly, and pecking in his _sujūd_, so he said, “Were this man to die in this state, he would die on a faith other than that of Muḥammad, [pecking in his prayer as a crow pecks at blood; he who does not make _rukūʿ_ completely and pecks in his _sujūd_ is like the hungry person who eats one or two dates, which are of no use to him at all.]”[^d39]

Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said, “My close friend \pbuh forbade me from pecking in my prayer like a cockerel, from looking around like a fox, and from squatting like a monkey.”[^d40]

The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh also used to say, “The worst thief among men is the one who steals from his prayer.” They said, “O Messenger of Allāh, how does he steal from his prayer?” He said, “He does not complete its _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_.”[^d41]

Once, he \pbuh was praying, when he glanced out of the corner of his eye at a man not settling his backbone in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_. Upon finishing, he \pbuh said, “O Assembly of Muslims! Verily, the prayer is not valid of the one who does not settle his spine in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_.”[^d42]

He said in another _ḥadīth_, “The prayer of a man does not count unless he straightens his back in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_.”[^d43]

## The _adhkār_ in _rukūʿ_

He would say different types of remembrance of Allāh and supplication, any one of the following at a time:

1.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ!\end{Arabicitem}

    “How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme!,” [three times]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.[^d44] But sometimes, he would repeat it more than that.[^d45] Once, in night prayer, he repeated it so much that his _rukūʿ_ became nearly as long as his standing before it, in which he had recited three of the Long Sūrahs: _al-Baqarah_, _al-Nisā_, and _Āl ʿImrān_. This prayer was full of supplication and seeking forgiveness, and the _ḥadīth_ has already been mentioned under \hyperref[tahajjud-prayer]{\textit{Recitation in Tahajjud Prayer}}.

2.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ وبِحَمْدِهِ.\end{Arabicitem}

    “How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, and Praised be He,” [three times]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.[^d46]

3.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبُّوحٌ قُدُّوسٌ، رَبُّ الْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالرُّوحِ.\end{Arabicitem}

    “Perfect, Blessed,[^d47] Lord of the Angels and the Spirit.”[^d48]

4.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، اللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي.\end{Arabicitem}

    “How Perfect You are O Allāh, and Praises are for You. O Allāh, forgive me.” He would say it often in his _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_, implementing (the order of\kern 1.6pt) the Quran.[^d49]

5.  \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ رَكَعْتُ، وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ، وَلَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ، [أَنْتَ رَبِّي،] خَشَعَ لَكَ سَمْعِي وَبَصَرِي وَمُخِّي وَعَظْمِي (وَفِي رِوَايَة: وَعِظَامِي) وَعَصَبِي، [وَمَا اسْتَقَلَّتْ بِهِ قَدَمَيَّ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ].\end{Arabicitem}

    “O Allāh! To You I have bowed; in You I have believed; to You I have submitted; [You are my Lord]; humbled for You are my hearing, my seeing, my marrow, my bone (in one narration: my bones), my sinews, [and whatever my feet carry[^d50](are humbled) for Allāh, Lord of the Worlds].”[^d51]

6.  \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ رَكَعْتُ، وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ، وَلَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ، وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ، أَنْتَ رَبِّي، خَشَعَ سَمْعِي وَبَصَرِي وَدَمِي وَلَحْمِي وَعَظْمِي وَعَصَبِي لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ.\end{Arabicitem}

    “O Allāh! To You I have bowed; in You I have believed; to You I have submitted; in You I have placed my trust; You are my Lord; my hearing, my seeing, my blood, my flesh, my bones, and my sinews are humbled for Allāh, Lord of the Worlds.”[^d52]

7.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْجَبَرُوتِ وَالْمَلَكُوتِ وَالْكِبْرِيَاءِ وَالْعَظَمَةِ.\end{Arabicitem}

    “How Perfect is He Who has all Power, Kingdom, Magnificence, and Supremacy,” which he used to say in night prayer.

## Lengthening the _rukūʿ_

He \pbuh used to make his _rukūʿ_, his standing after _rukūʿ_, his _sujūd_, and his sitting in between the two _sajdahs_, nearly equal in length.[^d53]

## Forbiddance of reciting the Quran in _rukūʿ_

He used to forbid recitation of the Quran in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_.[^d54] Further, he used to say, “Verily, I have indeed been forbidden from reciting the Quran in _rukūʿ_ or _sujūd_. In the _rukūʿ_, therefore, glorify the Supremacy of the Lord, Almighty and Sublime, in it; as for the _sujūd_, exert yourselves in supplication in it, for it is most likely that you will be answered.”[^d55]

## Rising from _rukūʿ_ and what is to be said then

Next, he \pbuh would straighten up his back out of _rukūʿ_, saying,

<div lang="ar">سَمِعَ اللهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ.</div>  
“Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.”[^d56]

He \pbuh also ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do that, when he said to him: “No person's prayer is complete until...he has said _takbīr_...then made _rukūʿ_...then has said ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him’ until he is standing straight.”[^d57] When he raised his head, he would stand straight until every vertebra returned to its place.[^d58]

Next, he \pbuh would say while standing,

<div lang="ar">رَبَّنَا [وَ]لَكَ الْحَمْدُ.</div>  
“Our Lord, [and] to You be all Praise.”[^d59]

He \pbuh has commanded all worshipers, whether behind an Imam or not, to do the above on rising from _rukūʿ_, by saying “Pray as you have seen me praying.”[^d60]

He \pbuh also used to say, “The Imam is there to be followed...when he has said ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him’ then say, ‘[O Allāh!] Our Lord, and to You be all Praise;’ Allāh will listen to you, for indeed, Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, has said via the tongue of His Prophet \pbuh: ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.’”[^d61]

He \pbuh also gave a reason for this command in another _ḥadīth_, saying: “...for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven.”[^d62]

He \pbuh used to raise his hands when straightening up,[^d63] in the ways described under the \hyperref[intention-and-opening-takbux12br]{\textit{Opening Takbīr}}.

While standing, he \pbuh would say, as previously mentioned,

1.  \begin{Arabicitem}رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “Our Lord, and to You be all Praise;”[^d64] or

2.  \begin{Arabicitem}رَبَّنَا لَكَ الْحَمْدُ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “Our Lord, to You be all Praise.”[^d65]

Sometimes, he \pbuh would add at the beginning of either of these:

3.  \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ...\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh!...”[^d66]

    He \pbuh used to order others to do this, saying, “When the Imam says: ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him,’ then say: ‘O Allāh! Our Lord, to You be all Praise,’ for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven.”[^d67]

Sometimes, he \pbuh would add either:

4. \begin{Arabicitem}...مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، وَمِلْءَ الأَرْضِ، وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “...Filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever else You wish,”[^d68] or

5. \begin{Arabicitem}...مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، [وَمِلْءَ] الأَرْضِ، ومَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “...Filling the heavens, [filling] the earth, whatever is between them, and filling whatever else You wish.”[^d69]

Sometimes, he \pbuh would add even further:

6. \begin{Arabicitem}أَهْلَ الثَّنَاءِ وَالْمَجْدِ، لا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَلا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “Lord of Glory and Majesty! None can withhold what You grant, and none can grant what You withhold; nor can the possessions of an owner benefit him in front of You.”[^d70]

Or, sometimes, the addition would be:

7. \begin{Arabicitem}مِلْءَ السَّمَاوَاتِ، وَمِلْءَ الأَرْضِ، ومَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمِلْءَ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ، أَهْلَ الثَّنَاءِ وَالْمَجْدِ، أَحَقُّ مَا قَالَ العَبْدُ، وَكُلُّنَا لَكَ عَبْدٌ، [اللّٰهُمَّ] لا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، [وَلا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ،] وَلا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “Filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever else You wish. Lord of Glory and Majesty!---The truest thing a slave has said, and we are all slaves to You. [O Allāh!] None can withhold what You grant, [and none can grant what You withhold,] nor can the possessions of an owner benefit him in front of You.”[^d71]

Sometimes, he \pbuh would say the following during night prayer:

8. \begin{Arabicitem}لِرَبِّيَ الْحَمْدُ، لِرَبِّيَ الْحَمْدُ.\end{Arabicitem}
    “To my Lord be all Praise, to my Lord be all Praise,” repeating it until his standing was about as long as his _rukūʿ_, which had been nearly as long as his first standing, in which he had recited _al-Baqarah_ (Quran, 2).[^d72]

9. \begin{Arabicitem}رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ حَمْداً كَثِيراً طَيِّباً مُبَارَكاً فِيهِ، [مُبَارَكاً عَلَيْهِ كَمَا يُحِبُّ رَبُّنَا وَيَرْضَى].\end{Arabicitem}  
    “Our Lord, and to You be all Praise, so much pure praise, inherently blessed, [externally blessed, as our Lord loves and is pleased with].”[^d73]

    A man praying behind him \pbuh said this after he \pbuh had raised his head from _rukūʿ_ and said: “Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.” When the Messenger of Allāh had finished his prayer, he said, “Who was the one speaking just now?” The man said, “It was I, O Messenger of Allāh.” So the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, “I saw over thirty angels hurrying to be the first one to write it down.”[^d74]

## Lengthening this standing and the obligation to be at ease in it

He \pbuh used to make this standing about as long as his _rukūʿ_, as has been mentioned; in fact, he would stand (for so long) sometimes that one would say, “He has forgotten,” [because of his standing for so long.][^d75]

He \pbuh used to instruct them to be at ease in it; hence, he said to _the one who prayed badly_, “...next, raise your head until you are standing straight [and every bone has taken its proper place]”---in another narration, “When you rise, make your spine upright and raise your head, until the bones return to their joints.”[^d76]

He \pbuh also reminded him that no one's prayer is complete unless he does that, and used to say: “Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, does not look at the prayer of the slave who does not make his backbone upright in between his bowings and prostrations.”[^d77]
