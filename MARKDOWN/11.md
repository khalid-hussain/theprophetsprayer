# The Taslīm

Next, he \pbuh would salute to his right:

<div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ.</div>  
“Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you [such that the whiteness of his right cheek was visible],” and on his left:

<div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ.</div>  
“Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you [such that the whiteness of his left cheek was visible].”[^i277] Sometimes, he would add to the greeting on the right:

<div lang="ar">وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.</div>  
“...and His blessings (be on you).”[^i278] When he \pbuh said:

<div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ.</div>  
“Peace and Allāh's Mercy be on you” to his right, he would sometimes shorten the greeting on his left to:

<div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم.</div>  
“Peace be on you.”[^i279] Sometimes, he \pbuh would salute once only,

<div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم.</div>  
“Peace be on you,” [in front of his face, turning to his right side a bit (or a little)].[^i280]

They used to gesture with their hands when saluting to the right and left; when the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh saw them, he said, “What is the matter with you, gesturing with your hands as if they are the tails of wild horses?! When one of you salutes, he should look towards his companion and not indicate with his hand. [So when they prayed with him, they did not gesture.] (In one narration: It is enough for each of you to place his hand on his thigh, and then salute his brothers who are on his right and left).”[^i281]

## The obligation of the _taslīm_

He \pbuh used to say, “...it (the prayer) is exited by the _taslīm_.”[^i282]

This is the last of what has been possible to compile regarding the description of the Prophet's prayer \pbuh from the _takbīr_ to the _taslīm_: I hope that Allāh will make it sincerely for His Face, Full of Honor, and a guide to the Sunnah of His kind and merciful Prophet.

<div lang="ar">سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهُ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ.</div>

Glorified be Allāh, and Praised. Glorified be You, O Allāh, and Praised. I bear witness that there is no true god except You. I seek forgiveness from You and repent to You.

<div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ و بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَآلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.</div>

O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, and send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as You sent prayers on Ibrāhīm and the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.[^i283]
