[^b14]: I now say: Muḥammad al-Ghazzālī's recent writings such as his newly-released book entitled _al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah bayna Ahl al-Ḥadīth wa Ahl al-Fiqh (The Prophetic Sunnah between the People of Ḥadīth and the People of Fiqh)_ have confirmed that he himself is one of those inviters to Islam who are “themselves utterly confused”! His writings have for long betrayed his confusion, his distortion of the Sunnah, and his using his intellect to authenticate or falsify _aḥādīth_, not by turning to the principles and science of _ḥadīth_, nor to the experts of that field; instead, whatever appeals to him, he authenticates, even if it is weak, and declares unreliable whatever is not to his liking, even if it is agreed to be authentic!

    His above approach is shown most obviously in his discussion of the _aḥādīth_ in his previous book _Fiqh al-Sīrah_, where he explains his methodology of accepting unreliable _aḥādīth_ and discarding authentic ones on the basis of the text of the _ḥadīth_ alone, from which the reader can see that the objective criticism of _ḥadīth_ has no value in his eyes if it contradicts a “reasoned analysis,” which varies enormously from person to person, for what is truth to one is falsehood to another! Thus the whole of Islam becomes subject to personal whims, having no principles nor reference points except personal opinion; this is poles apart from the position of the early leading _ʿUlamā_ of Islam, “that the _Isnād_ is part of the religion; were it not for the _Isnād_, people would have said whatever they wished.”

    His latest above-mentioned book has exposed to the people his Muʿtazilite methodology, his blatant disregard for the Imams of _Ḥadīth_ and their efforts over the ages in serving the Sunnah, and distinguishing the genuine traditions from the unreliable ones, and his lack of appreciation of the efforts of the Imams of _Fiqh_ in their laying down principles and developing issues on that basis, for he takes from these and leaves from them whatever he wishes, with no consistency towards any set of principles or fundamentals!
