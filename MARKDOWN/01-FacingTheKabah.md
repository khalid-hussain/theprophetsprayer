# Facing the Kaʿbah

When the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh stood for prayer, he would face the _Kaʿbah_ in both obligatory and voluntary prayers,[^c1] and he ordered that, saying to the _one who prayed badly_,[^c2] “When you stand for prayer, perform ablution perfectly, then face the _qiblah_ and say _takbīr_.”[^c3]

During a journey, he \pbuh would pray voluntary prayers and _witr_ on his mount, wherever it faced carrying him [east or west].[^c4]

The saying of Allāh, the Exalted, «Wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allāh» (Quran, 2:115) applies to this.[^c5]

[Sometimes] when he \pbuh intended to pray non-obligatory prayers on his she-camel, he would make it face the _qiblah_, say _takbīr_, and pray towards wherever his mount turned its face.[^c6]

He \pbuh would make _rukūʿ_ and _sajdah_ on his mount by lowering his head, making the _sajdah_ lower than the _rukūʿ_.[^c7]

When he \pbuh intended to pray obligatory prayers, he would dismount and face the _qiblah_.”[^c8]

In prayer during severe fear, he \pbuh set the example for his _Ummah_ to pray on foot, standing on their feet, or mounted; facing the _qiblah_ or not facing it,[^c9] and he also said, “When they (the armies) meet, then it (i.e. the prayer) is _takbīr_ and indication with the head.”[^c10]

He \pbuh also used to say, “What is between the east and the west is _qiblah_.”[^c11]

Jābir \mabpwhim said:

> Once, when we were with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh on an expedition, the sky was cloudy, so we tried to find the _qiblah_ but we differed, so each one of us prayed in a different direction, and each of us drew marks in front of him in order to mark our positions. In the morning, we looked at it and found that we had not prayed towards the _qiblah_. So we mentioned this to the Prophet \pbuh [but he did not order us to repeat (the prayer)] and he said: “Your prayer was sufficient.”[^c12]

He \pbuh used to pray towards _Bayt al-Muqaddas_ [with the _Kaʿbah_ in front of him] before the following verse was revealed: «We see the turning of your faces to the heavens; now shall we turn you to a _qiblah_ that shall please you: turn then your faces in the direction of the Sacred Mosque.» (Quran, 2:144) When it was revealed, he faced the _Kaʿbah_. There were people at Qubā praying _Fajr_ when someone came to them and said, “Verily the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh has had some of the Quran revealed to him last night and he has been ordered to face the _Kaʿbah_, [verily] so face it.” Their faces were towards Shām, so they turned round [and their Imam turned round to face the _qiblah_ along with them].[^c13]
