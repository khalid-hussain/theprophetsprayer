Next, he \pbuh would sit for _tashahhud_ after finishing the second _rakʿah_. In a two _rakʿah_ prayer such as _Fajr_, he \pbuh would sit _muftarishan_,[^g175] as he used to sit between the two _sajdahs_, and he \pbuh would sit in the first _tashahhud_ similarly[^g176] in a three- or four-_rakʿah_ prayer.

He also ordered _the one who prayed badly_ thus, saying to him, “When you sit in the middle of the prayer, then be calm, spread your left thigh and perform _tashahhud_.”[^g177]

Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said, “My friend \pbuh forbade me from squatting (_iqʿā_) like a dog;”[^g178] in another _ḥadīth_, “he \pbuh used to forbid the squatting of the devil.”[^g179]

When he \pbuh sat in _tashahhud_, he would place his right palm on his right thigh (in one narration: knee), and his left palm on his left thigh (in one narration: knee, spreading it upon it);[^g180] and he \pbuh would put the end of his right elbow on his right thigh.[^g181]

Also, he \pbuh forbade a man who was sitting in prayer resting on his left hand, and said: “Verily, that is the prayer of the Jews;”[^g182] in one wording, “Do not sit like this, for indeed this is the way of sitting of those who are punished;”[^g183] in another _ḥadīth_, “It is the sitting posture of those who incurred (Allāh's) anger.”[^g184]

## Moving the finger in _tashahhud_

He \pbuh would spread his left palm on his left knee, clench all the fingers of his right hand, point with the finger adjacent to the thumb towards the _qiblah_, and fix his sight on it (i.e. the finger).[^g185]

Also, when he \pbuh pointed with his finger, he would put his thumb on his middle finger,[^g186] and sometimes he \pbuh would make a circle with these two.[^g187]

When he \pbuh raised his finger, he would move it, supplicating with it,[^g188] and he \pbuh used to say, “It is surely more powerful against the devil than iron, meaning the forefinger.”[^g189]

Also, the Companions of the Prophet \pbuh used to remind each other, that is, about pointing with the finger when supplicating.[^g190]

Once, he \pbuh saw a man supplicating with two fingers, so he said, “Make it one, [make it one,]” and indicated with his forefinger.[^g191]

He \pbuh would do this in both _tashahhuds_.[^g192]

## The obligation of the first _tashahhud_ and the validity of supplication during it

He \pbuh would recite the _Taḥiyyah_ after every two _rakʿahs_;[^g193] the first thing he \pbuh would say in this sitting would be: “All compliments be to Allāh.”[^g194]

When he \pbuh forgot to perform the _tashahhud_ after the first two _rakʿahs_, he would prostrate (twice) for forgetfulness.[^g195]

He \pbuh used to order them to perform _tashahhud_, saying, “When you sit after every two _rakʿahs_, then say: ‘All compliments...’ and then each of you should select the supplication he likes best and supplicate to Allāh, Mighty and Sublime [with it];”[^g196] in another version: “Say, ‘All compliments...’ in every sitting,”[^g197] and he \pbuh also ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do so, as has been mentioned.

He \pbuh would teach them the _tashahhud_ the way he taught them _Sūrahs_ of the Quran,[^g198] and the Sunnah is to say it quietly.[^g199]

## Manner of _tashahhud_

He taught several ways of _tashahhud_.

1. The _tashahhud_ of Ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim, who said, “The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh taught me the _tashahhud_, [with] my palm between his palms, the way he taught me _Sūrahs_ of the Quran:

    <div lang="ar">التَّحِيَّـاتُ للهِ وَالصَّلَـوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَـاتُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.</div>  
    ‘All compliments,[^g200] prayers,[^g201] and pure words[^g202] are due to Allāh. Peace be on you,[^g203] O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings.[^g204] Peace be on us, and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. [For when one says that, it includes every righteous slave in the heaven and the earth]. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and messenger.’

    This was while he was among us, but after he was taken, we would say:

    <div lang="ar">السَّلَامُ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ.</div>  
    ‘Peace be on the Prophet.’\thinspace”[^g205]

2. The _tashahhud_ of Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo: “The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh used to teach us the _tashahhud_ the way he taught us [_Sūrahs_ of] the Quran; he used to say,

    <div lang="ar">التَّحِيَّـاتُ الْمُبَارَكَاتُ، الصَّلَـوَاتُ الطَّيِّبَـاتُ للهِ، [الـ]سلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، [الـ]سلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَ[أَشْهَدُ] أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً رَسُولُ اللهِ (وَفِي رِوَايَة: عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ).</div>  
    ‘All compliments, blessed words, prayers, and pure words are due to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh, and [I bear witness] that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh (in one narration: ...is His slave and messenger).’”[^g206]

3. The _tashahhud_ of Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo, who reported the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh as saying in the _tashahhud_:

    <div lang="ar">التَّحِيَّاتُ للهِ [وَ]الصَّلَوَاتُ [وَ]الطَّيِّبَاتُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ [وَبَرَكَاتُهُ] السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ [وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ] وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.</div>  
    “All compliments, prayers, and good words are due to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh.”---Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo said, “I add:[^g207] ‘...and His blessings.’” ---“Peace be on us and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh”---Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo said, “I add:[^g208] ‘...alone, He has no partner,’”---“and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and messenger.”[^g209]

4. The _tashahhud_ of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī \mabpwhim, who said that the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, “...when you are sitting, the first thing each of you says should be:

    <div lang="ar">التَّحِيَّاتُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ، الصَّلَوَاتُ للهِ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ [وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ]، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.</div>  
    ‘All compliments, good words and prayers are due to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings. Peace be on us, and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh [alone, He has no partner], and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and messenger.’ ---seven phrases, and they are the greetings in the prayer.”[^g210]

5. The _tashahhud_ of ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb \mabpwhim, who would teach the people the _tashahhud_ while on the pulpit, saying, “Say:

    <div lang="ar">التَّحِيَّاتُ للهِ، الزَّاكِيَاتُ للهِ، الطَّيِّبَاتُ للهِ، الصَّلَوَاتُ للهِ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيَّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادُ اللهِ الصَّالِحِيْن أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.</div>  
    ‘All compliments are due to Allāh; all pure titles are due to Allāh; all good words [are due to Allāh]; all prayers are due to Allāh. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous slaves of Allāh. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and messenger.’\thinspace”[^g211]

## Sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh

He \pbuh used to send prayers on himself in the first _tashahhud_ as well as the other.[^g212] He also established it for his _Ummah_, ordering them to send prayers on him after sending peace on him,[^g213] and he taught them several ways of doing so:

1. \begin{Arabicitem}اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ، وَعَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ، وَبارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ، وَعَلَى أَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ، كَمَا بارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad,[^g214] and on his household, and on his wives and progeny, as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings on Muḥammad,[^g215] and his household, and his wives and progeny, as you sent blessings on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.” This supplication he would use himself.[^g216]

2. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى [إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَعَلَى] آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللّٰهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى [إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى] آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on [Ibrāhīm, and on][^g217] the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O Allāh! Send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on [Ibrāhīm, and on][^g218] the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”[^g219]

3. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى [إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَعَلَى] آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللّٰهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى [إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى] آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on Ibrāhīm, [and the family of Ibrāhīm]; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on [Ibrāhīm, and] the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”[^g220]

4. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ [النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ]، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى [آلِ] إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ [النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ]، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى [آلِ] إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي العَالَمِينَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad [the Unlettered Prophet], and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on [the family of] Ibrāhīm; and send blessings on Muḥammad [the Unlettered Prophet] and the family of Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on [the family of] Ibrāhīm among the nations; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”[^g221]

5. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ عَبْدِكَ وَرَسُولِكَ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى [آلِ] إِبْرَاهِيْمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ [عَبْدِكَ وَرَسُولِكَ]، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيْمَ [وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيْمَ].\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, as You sent prayers on [the family of] Ibrāhīm. And send blessings on Muḥammad [Your slave and messenger], as you sent blessings on Ibrāhīm [and on the family of Ibrāhīm].”[^g222]

6. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَ[عَلَى] أَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى [آلِ] إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ[عَلَى] أَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى [آلِ] إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, his wives and his progeny, as You sent prayers on [the family of] Ibrāhīm. And send blessings on Muḥammad, his wives and his progeny, as You sent blessings on [the family of] Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”[^g223]

7. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ وبَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَآلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad and on the family of Muḥammad, and send blessings on Muḥammad and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers and sent blessings on Ibrāhīm and the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”[^g224]

## Notes about sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh

1. It can be seen that in most of these ways of sending prayers on the Prophet \pbuh, there is no mention of Ibrāhīm separate from his family, the wording being, “...as you have sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm.” The reason for this is that in Arabic, the family of a man includes the man as well as his dependents, e.g. in the words of the Exalted, «Allāh has chosen Ādam, Nūḥ, the family of Ibrāhīm, and the family of ʿImrān above all people.» (Quran, 3:33).

    «We sent against them a violent tornado with showers of stones, except the family of Lūṭ ---We delivered them by early dawn.» (Quran, 54:34); similar is his saying \pbuh, “O Allāh! Send prayers on the family of Abū Awfā.” The phrase _Ahl al-Bayt_ (People of the House) is also like this, e.g. «Allāh's grace and His blessings be on you, O People of the House.» (Quran, 11:73). Hence, Ibrāhīm is included in “the family of Ibrāhīm.”

    Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah says,

    > Most of the versions have, “as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm” and “as you sent blessings on the family of Ibrāhīm;” some have “Ibrāhīm” himself. This is because he is the cause of all prayers and purifications on them; the rest of his family are secondary recipients of all that. To show these two points, both wordings have been employed separately.

    Further, there is a well-known question among the people of knowledge about the nature of the comparison in his statement, “as you sent prayers on...,” for it is true that the model for comparison is normally superior to the one being compared; here, the opposite is the case, since Muḥammad \pbuh is greater than Ibrāhīm, and so his superiority dictates that the prayers requested are more excellent than any prayers received or to be received by anyone else. The people of knowledge have provided many answers to this, and these can be found in _Fatḥ al-Bārī_ and _Jalā al-Ifhām_. They amount to about ten views, all of which are unsubstantiated, some weaker than others, except one, a well-supported view, and adopted by Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. This view is: “The family of Ibrāhīm includes many prophets; none like them is found in the family of Muḥammad. Therefore, when prayers on the Prophet \pbuh and his family are sought similar to that bestowed on Ibrāhīm and his family, which includes prophets, the family of Muḥammad receives out of that what is appropriate for them. Since the family of Muḥammad does not reach the rank of the prophets, the extra blessings and benefit given to the prophets, including Ibrāhīm, are left for Muḥammad \pbuh. Thus he gains a distinguished position which others cannot reach.”

    Ibn al-Qayyim says,

    > This is the best of all the previous views: that Muḥammad \pbuh is one of the family of Ibrāhīm; in fact, he is the best of the family of Ibrāhīm, as ʿAlī ibn Ṭalḥah has related from Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo about the saying of the Exalted, «Allāh has chosen Ādam, Nūḥ, the family of Ibrāhīm, and the family of ʿImrān above all people» (Quran, 3:33); Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo said, “Muḥammad is among the family of Ibrāhīm.” This is text for the fact that if other prophets descended from Ibrāhīm are included in his family, then the inclusion of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh is more fitting. Hence our saying, “...as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm,” includes the prayers sent on him and on the rest of the prophets descended from Ibrāhīm. Allāh has then ordered us to specifically send prayers on Muḥammad and his family, as much as we send prayers on him, along with the rest of Ibrāhīm's family generally. Therefore, the Prophet's family receives out of that what is appropriate for them, leaving all of the remainder to him \pbuh. There is no doubt that the total amount of prayers received by Ibrāhīm's family, with the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh among them, is greater than that received by the Prophet \pbuh alone. Therefore, what is sought for him is such a great favor, definitely superior than that sought for Ibrāhīm. Hence, the nature of the comparison and its consistency become clear. The prayers sought for him with these words are greater than those requested any other way, since what is requested with the supplication is that it be as much as the model of comparison, and that the Prophet \pbuh receives a large portion: the comparison dictates that what is requested is more than what was given to Ibrāhīm and others. Thus, the excellence and nobility of Muḥammad \pbuh, over and above Ibrāhīm and his family, which includes many prophets, is evident, and is as he deserves. This sending of prayers on the Prophet \pbuh becomes evidence for this excellence of his, and this is no more than he deserves. So, may Allāh send prayers on him and on his family, and send peace on them, many greetings of peace, and reward him from our supplications better than He has rewarded any prophet from his people. O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.

2. The reader will see that this part of the prayer, with all its different types, is always a sending of prayers on the family of the Prophet \pbuh: on his wives and children as well as himself. Therefore, it is neither from the Sunnah, nor carrying out the Prophet's command, to leave it at “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad” only. Rather, one of these complete types of supplication must be used, as is reported from his \pbuh action, whether in the first or the last _tashahhud_. There is text about this from Imam al-Shāfiʿī in _al-Umm_: “The _tashahhud_ in the first and second instance is the same thing; by _tashahhud_, I mean the bearing of witness and the sending of prayers on the Prophet \pbuh: neither will suffice without the other.”

    In fact, one of the most amazing things to arise from this age and its intellectual anarchy is that one person, Muḥammad Isʿāf al-Nashāshībī, in his book _al-Islām al-Ṣaḥīḥ (The Correct Islām)_, had the audacity to reject the sending of prayers on the family of the Prophet \pbuh when sending prayers on him, despite it being firmly established in the _Ṣaḥīḥs_ of al-Bukhārī and Muslim, and elsewhere, on the authority of several Companions, e.g. Kaʿb ibn ʿUjrah, Abū Ḥumayd al-Sāʿidī, Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, Abū Masʿūd al-Anṣārī, Abū Hurayrah and Ṭalḥah ibn ʿUbayd Allāh \mabpwthem! In their _aḥādīth_, it is found that they asked the Prophet \pbuh, “How do we send prayers on you?” so he taught them this way of doing so. Al-Nashāshībī's argument for his view is that Allāh the Exalted did not mention anyone else with the Prophet \pbuh in His saying: «O you who believe! Send prayers on him, and salute him with all respect.» (Quran, 33:56) He then goes on to say in his refutation that the Companions asked him \pbuh that question because the meaning of _ṣalāh_ was known to them as _supplication_, so they were asking: “How can we supplicate to you?”!

    This is a clear deception, for their question was not about the meaning of _ṣalāh_ on him, in which case he would have a point, but it was about the manner of doing the _ṣalāh_ on him, as is found in the narrations to which we have referred. Thus it all fits, for they asked him about the way of doing it according to the Sharīʿah, something which they could not possibly find out except from the guidance of the All-Knowing, All-Wise, Giver of the _ṣalāh_. Similarly, they could also ask him about the way of performing the _Ṣalāh_ made obligatory by words of the Exalted such as «Establish the _Ṣalāh_ (Prayer);» for their knowledge of the literal meaning of _Ṣalāh_ could not remove their need to ask about its manner according to the Sharīʿah, and this is crystal clear.

    As for al-Nashāshībī's argument referred to, it is of no consequence, for it is well-known among the Muslims that the Prophet \pbuh is the expounder of the words of the Lord of the Worlds, as He says:

    \begin{aquote}{\quran: \nahl{} 44}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/16_44}
    \end{center}
    And We have sent down to you the Message, that you may explain clearly to the people what is sent for them,
    \end{aquote}

    Hence, the Prophet \pbuh explained the way of doing _ṣalāh_ on him, and it included mention of his family, so it is compulsory to accept that from him, due to Allāh's saying:

    «So take what the Messenger gives you» (Quran, 59:7), and the well-known authentic _ḥadīth_, “Verily, I have been given the Quran and something similar to it.”[^g225]

    I really wonder what al-Nashāshībī and those taken in by his pompous words would say if someone were to reject the _tashahhud_ in prayer altogether, or reject the menstruating woman's abstaining from prayer and fasting, all with the argument that Allāh the Exalted did not mention the _tashahhud_ in the Quran; He only mentioned bowing and prostration, and He did not exempt a menstruating woman from prayer and fasting in the Quran! So, do they agree with such arguments, which are along the lines of his original one, or not? If they do, and we hope not, then they have strayed far, far away from guidance, and have left the mainstream of the Muslims; if they do not, then they are correct in agreeing with us, and their reasons for rejecting those arguments are exactly the same as our reasons for rejecting al-Nashāshībī's original pronouncement, which we have explained clearly.

    Therefore beware, O Muslims, of trying to understand the Quran without recourse to the Sunnah, for you will never be able to do that, even if you were the Sībawayh[^g226] of the age; the expert of the age in the Arabic language. Here is an example in front of you, for this al-Nashāshībī is one of the leading scholars of the Arabic language of this period; you have seen how he has strayed, after being deceived by his knowledge of the language, by not seeking the aid of the Sunnah in understanding the Quran; in fact he has rejected this aid, as you know. There are many other examples of this---there is not enough room here to mention them, but what we have mentioned will suffice, and Allāh is the Granter of all capability.

3. The reader will also see that in none of these types of _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh is there the word _sayyid_ (chief, leader). The later scholars have differed about the validity of its inclusion in the _Ibrāhīmī ṣalāh_. Due to lack of space we will not go into the details of that nor make mention of those who rejected its validity in keeping with the Prophet's \pbuh complete teaching to his _Ummah_ when he instructed, “Say: O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad...” on being asked about the manner of _ṣalāh_ on him, but we will quote al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī on this, bearing in mind his position as one of the great Shāfiʿī scholars of both _ḥadīth_ and _fiqh_, for contradiction of this teaching of the Prophet \pbuh has become widespread among Shāfiʿī scholars!

    Al-Ḥāfiẓ Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghurābīlī ([ah]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}\ 790--835), a companion of Ibn Ḥajr, said, and I quote from his manuscript:[^g227]

    > He (i.e. Ibn Ḥajr), may Allāh benefit us with his life, was asked about the features of _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh, whether during prayer or outside it, compulsory or recommended: Is one of its conditions that the Prophet \pbuh be attributed with _sayādah_ (leadership), e.g. “O Allāh! Send prayers on _sayyidinā_ (our leader) Muḥammad...” or “the foremost of creation,” or “the leader of the children of Ādam,” etc.? or should one stick to “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad”? Which of these two is the better approach: including the word _sayyid_, due to it being an established attribute of the Prophet \pbuh, or leaving it out due to the absence of it in the narrations? He (Ibn Ḥajr), may Allāh be pleased with him, replied: Yes, to follow the narrated wording is superior. It cannot be said, “Maybe the Prophet \pbuh himself did not say it out of modesty, just as he did not say \pbuh on mention of his name, although his _Ummah_ has been encouraged to do so”---for we say that if that were superior, it would have been quoted from the Companions \mabpwthem and then from the Successors, but we do not come across it in any narrations from any Companion or Successor. This is despite the volume of quotations from them. We have Imam al-Shāfiʿī, may Allāh exalt his rank, one of the foremost among men in his respect for the Prophet \pbuh, saying in the preface to his book which is a base for the people of his _madhhab_: “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad...etc.” until the end of what his judgment dictated, “...every time one of the rememberers remembers him, and every time one of the heedless fails to remember him,” which he seems to have deduced from the authentic _ḥadīth_ which has in it that the Prophet \pbuh saw the Mother of the Believers engaging in long and numerous glorifications, so he said to her, “You have said words which, if weighed against the following, would be balanced: ‘Glorified be Allāh, as many times as the number of His creation;’” He \pbuh used to like supplications which were concise, but exhaustive in meaning. Al-Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ set out a chapter about _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh in his book _al-Shifā (The Book of Cure)_, noting in it narrations from the Prophet \pbuh on the authority of several Companions \mabpwthem and Successors; in none of these is the word _sayyid_ reported:

    > a. The _ḥadīth_ of ʿAlī \mabpwhim, that he used to teach them the manner of _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh by saying, “O Allāh, Spreader of Plains, Originator of Heights, send the foremost of Your prayers, the most fertile of Your blessings, and any remaining compliments, on Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, the opener of what is closed.”

    > b. Again from ʿAlī \mabpwhim, that he used to say, “The prayers of Allāh, the Beneficent, the Merciful, of the Angels nearest (to Allāh), of the Prophets, of the Sincere ones, of the Witnesses, of the Righteous, and of whatever glorifies You, O Lord of the Worlds, be on Muḥammad son of ʿAbd Allāh, Seal of the Prophets, Imam of the God-fearing...etc.”

    > c. On the authority of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim, that he used to say, “O Allāh! Send Your prayers, Your blessings and Your mercy, on Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, the Imam of goodness, the messenger of mercy...etc.”

    > d. From al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, that he used to say, “Whoever wants to drink from the cup which quenches, from the fount of al-Musṭafā, should say: ‘O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on his family, his Companions, his wives, his children, his descendants, his household, his in-laws, his helpers, his followers, and all those who love him.’”

    > This is what he (al-Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ) has written in _al-Shifā_, regarding the manner of _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh, on the authority of the Companions and those who succeeded them, and he also mentioned other things in it. Yes, it is related in a _ḥadīth_ of Ibn Masʿūd \mabpwhim that in his _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh, he would say, “O Allāh! Send the best of Your prayers, mercy and blessings on the _sayyid_ (leader) of the messengers...etc.” transmitted by Ibn Mājah, but its _isnād_ is weak, so the _ḥadīth_ of ʿAlī \mabpwhim, transmitted by al-Ṭabarānī with a acceptable _isnād_, takes precedence. This _ḥadīth_ has difficult words, which I have reported and explained in the book _Faḍl al-Nabī (Excellence of the Prophet \pbuh)_ by Abū al-Ḥasan ibn al-Fāris. Some Shāfiʿīs have said that if a man took an oath to send the best _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh, the way to fulfill his oath would be to say, “O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad every time the rememberers remember him or the heedless fail to remember him;” Imam al-Nawawī said, “The one which is most fitting to be designated as correct is that one should say: ‘O Allāh! Send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on Ibrāhīm...’” Several of the later scholars have replied to this by saying that in neither of the two ways mentioned above is there anything to prove which is superior as regards narration, but as regards the meaning, then the former is clearly superior. This issue is well-known in the books of _fiqh_, and of all the scholars of _fiqh_ who addressed this issue, without exception, in none of their words does the word _sayyid_ appear. Had this additional word been commendable, it would not have escaped all of them, leaving them ignorant of it. All good is in following what is narrated, and Allāh knows best.

    Ibn Ḥajr's view of the unacceptability of describing the Prophet \pbuh as _sayyid_ during the _ṣalāh_ on him in accordance with the Quranic order, is also that of the Ḥanafī scholars. It is the view which must be adhered to, for it is a true indication of love for him \pbuh;

    \begin{aquote}{\quran: \imraan{} 31}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/3_31}
    \end{center}
    Say: If you do love Allāh, then follow me. Allāh will love you.
    \end{aquote}

    Because of this, Imam al-Nawawī said in _Rawḍah al-Ṭālibīn_ (1/265), “The most complete _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh is: ‘O Allāh! Send your prayers on Muḥammad...etc.’” corresponding to type 3 given, in which there is no mention of _sayyid_!

4. It should be known that types 1 and 4 are the ones which the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh taught his Companions when they asked about the manner of _ṣalāh_ on him, so this has been used as evidence that these are the best ways of doing the _ṣalāh_ on him, for he would not choose anything for them or himself except the best and noblest. Imam al-Nawawī, as mentioned, endorsed (in _Rawḍah al-Ṭālibīn_) that if a man were to take an oath to do the best possible _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh, this could not be fulfilled except in these ways.

    Al-Subkī has given another reason: “Whoever does _ṣalāh_ with those types has made _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh with certainty, and whoever does so with other words is in doubt whether or not he has performed the prayers as requested. This is because they said, ‘How do we send prayers on you?’ and he replied, ‘Say: ...,’ thus defining their _ṣalāh_ on him as their saying such-and-such.” This was mentioned by al-Haytamī in _al-Darr al-Manḍūd_ (25/2); he then said (27/1) that the objective is achieved with all the types which have occurred in authentic _aḥādīth_.

5. It should be known that it is not valid to combine all these way into one way of _ṣalāh_, and the same goes for the different _tashahhuds_ given previously. In fact, that would be an innovation in the religion; the Sunnah is to say different ones at different times, as Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah has explained in his discussion of the _takbīrs_ of the two Eids (_Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā_, 29/253/1).

6. ʿAllāmah Siddīq Ḥasan Khān says in his book _Nuzūl al-Abrār bi al-ʿIlm al-Maʾthūr min al-Adʿiyah wa al-Adhkār_, after giving many _aḥādīth_ about the excellence of repeated _ṣalāh_ on the Prophet \pbuh (p.\ 161):

    “There is no doubt that the foremost among the Muslims in sending _ṣalāh_ on him \pbuh are the People of Ḥadīth and the narrators of the purified Sunnah, for it is one of their duties in this noble branch of learning to make _ṣalāh_ on him before every _ḥadīth_, and so their tongues are always engaged in his mention, may Allah grant him mercy and peace. There is no book of Sunnah or collection of _ḥadīth_, be it a _jāmiʿ_, _musnad_, _muʿjam_, _juz_, etc. except that it comprises thousands of _aḥādīth_; even one of the least bulky ones, al-Suyūṭī's _al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr_, contains ten thousand _aḥādīth_, and the rest of the collections are no different. So this is the Saved Sect: the body of the People of Ḥadīth, who will be the closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh on the Day of Resurrection, and the most likely to be rewarded by his intercession \pbuh, may my mother and father be sacrificed for him! This excellence of the People of Ḥadīth cannot be surpassed by anyone unless he does more than what they do, something which is well-nigh impossible. Therefore, O desirer of good, seeker of salvation, no matter what, you should either be a _muḥaddith_, or be close to the _muḥaddithīn_; do not be otherwise...for apart from that there is nothing which will benefit you.”

I ask Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, to make me one of these People of Ḥadīth, who are the closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh; perhaps this book will be a testimony to that. May Allāh shower His mercy on Imam Aḥmad, who recited:

> | The religion of Muḥammad is in narrations,
> | The best mounts for a young man are the traditions;
> | Turn not away from _Ḥadīth_ and its people,
> | For Opinion is night, while _Ḥadīth_ is day,
> | A young man can be ignorant of the guidance...
> | Although the sun is shining in all its splendor!

## _Duʿā_ in the first _tashahhud_

He \pbuh also set the guidance of _duʿā_ in this _tashahhud_ as well, saying, “When you sit after every two _rakʿahs_, then say: ‘All compliments are due to Allāh...’ (till the end of that supplication, and then said:) ...then he should select of the supplications what is most pleasing to him.”[^g228]

## Standing up for the third, and then the fourth _rakʿah_

<!-- TODO check the following section -->

Next, he \pbuh would get up for the third _rakʿah_ with _takbīr_,[^g229] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do so. And then do that in every _rakʿah_, as before. When he \pbuh stood from the sitting position, he would say _takbīr_, and then stand up;[^g230] and he \pbuh would raise his hands[^g231] with this _takbīr_ sometimes.

When he \pbuh wanted to stand up for the fourth _rakʿah_, he would say: “Allāh is the Greatest,”[^g232] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ likewise, as before, and he \pbuh would raise his hands[^g233] with this _takbīr_ sometimes.

He \pbuh would sit up straight on his left foot, at ease, until every bone returned to its proper place, then stand up, supporting himself on the ground; and he would clench his fists,[^g234] supporting himself with his hands when standing up.[^g235]

He \pbuh would recite _al-Fātiḥah_ in both these _rakʿahs_, and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do that. In _Ẓuhr_ prayer, he \pbuh would sometimes add a few _āyāt_ to this, as has been explained under \hyperref[recitation-of-ux101yux101t-after-al-fux101tiux1e25ah-in-the-last-two-rakux2bfahs]{\textit{Recitation of āyāt after al-Fātiḥah in the last two rakʿahs}}.

## _Qunūt_ in the five prayers because of a calamity

When he \pbuh wanted to supplicate against someone, or supplicate for someone, he would perform _qunūt_[^g236] in the last _rakʿah_, after _rukūʿ_; after having said: “Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.”[^g237] He \pbuh would supplicate loudly,[^g238] raise his hands,[^g239] and those behind him would say: _āmīn_.[^g240]

He \pbuh was known to perform _qunūt_ in all five prayers,[^g241] although he would only perform _qunūt_ in them when he supplicated for a people or supplicated against a people.[^g242] For example, he \pbuh once said, “O Allāh! Rescue al-Walīd ibn al-Walīd, and Salamah ibn Hishām, and ʿAyyāsh ibn Abī Rabīʿah. O Allāh! Harden Your penalty on (the tribe of) Mudar, and cause for it years (of famine) like the years of Yūsuf. [O Allāh! Curse Lahyān, and Ruʾl, and Dhakwān, and ʿUsayyah, who disobeyed Allāh and His Messenger!]”[^g243] Then, he \pbuh would say: “Allāh is the Greatest” when he had finished _qunūt_ and prostrate.[^g244]

## _Qunūt_ in the _Witr_ Prayer

He \pbuh used to perform _qunūt_ in the (odd) _rakʿah_ of the _Witr_ prayer"[^g245] sometimes,[^g246] and he would perform it before _rukūʿ_.[^g247] He taught al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī \mabpwthemtwo to say [after finishing his recitation in _Witr_]:

<div lang="ar">اللّٰهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ، وَعَافِنِي فِيمَنْ عَافَيْتَ، وَتَوَلَّنِي فِيمَنْ تَوَلَّيْتَ، وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَقِنِي شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ، [فَـ]إِنَّكَ تَقْضِي وَلَا يُقْضَى عَلَيْكَ، [وَ]إِنَّهُ لَا يَذِلُّ مَنْ وَالَيْتَ، [وَلَا يَعِزُّ مَنْ عَادَيْتَ]، تَبَارَكْتَ رَبَّنَا وَتَعَالَيْتَ، [لَا مَنْجَا مِنْكَ إِلَّا إِلَيْكَ].</div>

“O Allāh! Guide me among those whom You have guided; and pardon me among those who You have pardoned; and turn on me in friendship among those on whom You have turned in friendship; and bless me in what You have bestowed; and save me from the evil of what You have decreed; [for] indeed You decree, and none can influence You; [and] he is not humiliated whom You have befriended; [nor is he honored who is Your enemy.] Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted. [There is no place of safety from You except towards You.]”[^g248]
