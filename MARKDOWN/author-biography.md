He was born in the city of Shkodër, then the capital of Albania, in the year [ah]{.smallcaps} 1332/1914 [ce]{.smallcaps} into a poor family. His father Ḥājj Nūḥ Najjātī al-Albānī had completed Sharīʿah studies in Istanbul and returned a scholar to Albania. After Albania was taken over by atheism, the family migrated to Damascus. In Damascus, Shaykh al-Albani completed his initial education and was then taught the Quran, *Tajwīd*, sciences of the Arabic language, *Fiqh* of the Ḥanafī Madhhab, and further branches of the *Dīn* by various *shaykhs* and friends of his father.

He also learnt from his father the art of clock and watch repair. He became highly skilled and famous for it and derived his earnings through it. He began to specialize in the field of _ḥadīth_ and its related sciences by the age of twenty after being influenced by articles in al-Manar magazine.

He began to work in this field by transcribing al-Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿIrāqī's monumental *al-Mughnī ʿan ḥaml al-Asfār fī al-Asfār fī Takhrīj mā fī al-Iḥyā min al-Akhbār* and adding notes to it.

He delved further into the field of *ḥadīth* and its various branches despite discouragement from his father. Furthermore, the books he needed were not to be found in his father's library which was composed mainly of various works of Ḥanafī Fiqh and since he could not afford many of the books he required, he would borrow them from the famous library of Damascus, al-Maktabah al-Ẓāhirīyyah, or sometimes from book sellers.

He became engrossed with the science of *ḥadīth* to the extent that he would sometimes close up his shop and stay in the library for up to twelve hours, breaking off his work only for prayer; he would not even leave to eat, but would take two light snacks with him.

Eventually the library authorities granted him a special room for his study and a key for access to the library before normal opening time. Often, he would remain at work from early morning until after ʿIshā prayer. During this time he produced many useful works, many of which are still waiting to be printed.

The Shaykh's studies of the Prophet's \pbuh \emph{ḥadīth} had a great effect on him and resulted in his turning away from blind following of his former *madhhab* and instead to accept and act upon the Book and the Sunnah, with the understanding of *al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ* (the pious predecessors). This naturally meant he was sometimes at variance with some of the local *shaykhs* who blindly followed the Ḥanafī Madhhab, and likewise with the local Ṣūfī Imams and innovators who began to oppose him and incite the common people against him by calling him a Wahābī deviant. However, he was encouraged by some of the noble Shaykhs of Damascus who urged him to continue. Amongst them Shaykh Bahjat al-Bayjār, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ, and Tawfīq al-Barzah.

The Shaykh therefore faced much opposition in his efforts to promote *Tawḥīd* and the Sunnah but he bore this with patience and perseverance. After some time he started giving two weekly classes attended by students and university teachers, in which he taught various books of *ʿaqīdah*, *fiqh*, and *uṣūl* and *ḥadīth* sciences. He also began organizing monthly journeys for *daʿwah* purposes to the various cities of Syria and Jordan.

After a number of his works appeared in print, the Shaykh was chosen to teach *ḥadīth* in the new Islamic University of al­-Madīnah, Saudi Arabia, for three years from [ah]{.smallcaps} 1381--1383, during which he was also a member of the university's board. After this, he returned to his former studies and work in al-Maktabah al-Ẓāhirīyyah, leaving his shop in the hands of one of his brothers.

He visited various countries for *daʿwah* and lectures, amongst them Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait, the Emirates, Spain, and England. He was forced to emigrate a number of times moving from Syria to Jordan, then Syria again, then Beirut, then the Emirates, then again to Amman, Jordan, where he resided till his death on 22 Jumāda al-Ākhirah [ah]{.smallcaps} 1420 (2 October 1999). His works---mainly in the field of *ḥadīth* and its sciences---number over a hundred.

His students are many and include many *shaykhs* of the present day. Amongst them Shaykh Ḥamdī ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Salafī, Shaykh Muḥammad ʿĪd ʿAbbāsī, Dr.\ ʿUmar Sulaymān al-Ashqar, Shaykh Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Shaqrah, Shaykh Muqbil bin Hādī al-Wādiʿī, Shaykh ʿAlī Khushshan, Shaykh Muḥammad Jamīl Zaynī, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al­-Ṣamad, Shaykh ʿAlī Ḥasan ʿAbd al-Ḥamīd al-Ḥalabī, Shaykh Sālim al-Hilālī, and Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al-Khāliq.
