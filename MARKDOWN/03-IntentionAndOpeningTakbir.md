# Intention and Opening Takbīr

\minitoc

He \pbuh used to say: “All actions are by intention,[^58] and every man shall have what he intended.”[^59]

---

Then he \pbuh would commence the prayer by saying:

<div lang="ar">اللهُ أَكْبَرُ.</div>  
“Allāh is the Greatest.”[^60]

He \pbuh ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do likewise as has been mentioned, and he said to him: “Verily, the prayer of a person is not complete until he has made an ablution which has included the necessary parts of the body and has then said: ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”[^61]

He \pbuh also used to say: “The key to the prayer is purification, it is entered by _takbīr_ and exited by _taslīm_.”[^62]

Also, he \pbuh used to raise his voice for the _takbīr_ such that those behind him could hear.[^63] But, when he fell ill Abū Bakr \mabpwhim used to raise his voice to convey the _takbīr_ of the Messenger \pbuh to the people.[^64]

He \pbuh would also say: “When the Imam says: ‘Allāhu Akbar,’ then say, ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”[^65]

## Raising the hands

He \pbuh would raise his hands sometimes with the _takbīr_,[^66] sometimes after the _takbīr_,[^67] and sometimes before it.[^68]

He \pbuh would raise them with fingers apart [not spaced out completely, nor together],[^69] and he would put them level with his shoulders,[^70] although occasionally, he would raise them until they were level with [the tops of] his ears.[^71]

## The command to place the right arm on the left

He \pbuh used to place his right arm on his left,[^72] and he used to say: “We, the company of prophets, have been commanded to hasten the breaking of the fast, to delay the meal before the fast, and to place our right arms on our left arms during prayer.”[^73]

Also, he \pbuh passed by a man who was praying and had placed his left arm on his right, so he pulled them apart and placed the right on the left.[^74]

## To place the hands on the chest

He \pbuh used to place the right arm on the back of his left palm, wrist, and forearm,[^75] and he commanded his companions to do likewise,[^76] and (sometimes) he would grasp his left arm with his right.[^77]

He \pbuh used to place them on his chest.[^78]

Also, he \pbuh used to forbid putting one's hand on the waist during prayer [and he put his hand on his waist (to demonstrate)].[^79] And this is the _silb_ (cross) which he used to forbid.[^80]

## To look at the place of prostration and humility

He \pbuh used to incline his head during prayer and fix his sight towards the ground.[^81] While he was in the _Kaʿbah_, his sight did not leave the place of his prostration until he came out from it;[^82] and he said, “It is not fitting that there should be anything in the house which disturbs the person praying.”[^83]

He used to forbid looking up at the sky,[^84] and he emphasized this prohibition so much that he said: “People must refrain from looking up at the sky in prayer, or their sight will not return to them (and in one narration: or their sight will be plucked away).”[^85] In another _ḥadīth_: “So when you pray, do not look here and there, for Allāh sets His Face for the face of his slave in his prayer as long as he does not look away,”[^86] and he also said about looking here and there, “It is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer.”[^87]

He \pbuh also said: “Allāh does not cease to turn to a slave in his prayer as long as he is not looking around; when he turns his face away, Allāh turns away from him.”[^88] He \pbuh forbade three things: pecking like a hen, squatting (_iqʿā_) like a dog, and looking around like a fox.[^89] He \pbuh also used to say, “Pray a farewell prayer as if you see Him, but if you do not see Him, surely He sees you;”[^90] and, “Any person who, when an obligatory prayer is due, excels in its ablution, humility, and bowings, will have it as a remission for his previous minor sins as long as he does not commit a major sin, and this (opportunity) is for all times.”[^91]

Once he \pbuh, prayed in a _khamīṣah_ [^92] and (during the prayer) he looked at its marks. So when he finished, he said: “Take this _khamīṣah_ of mine to Abū Jahm and bring me his _anbijāniyyah_,[^93] for it has diverted my attention from the prayer (in one narration: for I have looked at its marks during the prayer and it almost put me to trial).”[^94] Similarly, ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher had a cloth with pictures spread towards a _sahwah_,[^95] towards which the Prophet \pbuh prayed and then said, “Take it away from me [for its pictures did not cease to thwart me in my prayer].”[^96]

He would also say: “Prayer is not valid when the food has been served, nor when it is time to relieve oneself of the two filths.”[^97]
