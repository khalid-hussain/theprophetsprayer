# The Second Rakʿah

When he \pbuh got up for the second _rakʿah_, he would commence with «All Praises be to Allāh» (Quran, 1:1), without pausing.[^f170]

He would perform this _rakʿah_ exactly as he performed the first, except that he would make it shorter than the first, as mentioned before.

## The obligation of reciting _al-Fātiḥah_ in every _rakʿah_

He ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to recite _al-Fātiḥah_ in every _rakʿah_, when he said to him after ordering him to recite it in the first _rakʿah_,[^f171] then do that throughout your prayer[^f172](in one narration: in every _rakʿah_).[^f173] He also used to say, “There is recitation in every _rakʿah_.”[^f174]
