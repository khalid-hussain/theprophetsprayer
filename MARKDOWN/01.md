# Introduction

In the Name of Allāh, the Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.

Praise be to Allāh, who made Prayer compulsory on his slaves and ordered them to establish it and perform it well; who linked success and felicity to humility in Prayer; who made it the criterion to distinguish between Īmān and Kufr; and who made it a restrainer from shameful and unjust deeds.

Prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Muḥammad, who was addressed in the Words of the Exalted:

\begin{aquote}{\quran: \nahl{} 44}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/16_44}
\end{center}

“And We have sent down to you the Message, that you may explain clearly to the people what is sent for them,”
\end{aquote}

<!-- [^a1] -->

and who fully carried out this task. The prayer was one of the most important things which he explained to the people, verbally and practically, even praying on the pulpit once---standing, bowing and prostrating, and then saying to them, “I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer.”[^a2] He obligated us to copy him in his prayer, saying, “Pray as you have seen me praying.”[^a3] He also gave the good tidings to whoever prayed like him that such a person has a covenant with Allāh that He will enter him into the Garden, saying, “There are five prayers which Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, has made compulsory: he who performs ablution well for them, prays them at their proper times, and is complete in their bowings, prostrations and humility, he has a guarantee from Allāh that He will forgive him; but he who does not do so, has no guarantee from Allāh: if He wishes, He will forgive him or if He wishes, He will punish him.”[^a4]

Prayers and peace be also on his family and his pious and just Companions, who passed on to us his worship, prayer, sayings and actions \pbuh, and who made these, and these alone, a _madhhab_ and a path for them to follow; and also on those who follow in their footsteps and tread their path until the Day of Judgment.

When I finished reading the book of prayer in _al-Targhīb wa al-Tarhīb_ by al-Ḥāfiẓ al-Mundhirī and teaching it to our brothers, four years ago, it became clear to us all the important position of the prayer in Islām; and the reward, grace and respect awaiting those who establish and perform it well; and that all this varies, depending on its closeness to the Prophet's prayer \pbuh. This is what he indicated in his saying, “Verily the slave prays a prayer of which nothing is written down for him except a tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, quarter, third or half of it.”[^a5] Therefore, I reminded the brothers that it is not possible for us to perform prayer as it should be performed, or even approach that, unless we know the detailed description of the Prophet's prayer \pbuh, including its essentials, manners, forms, supplications (_duʿā_) and remembrances (_adhkār_), and then we make an effort to put that knowledge into practice carefully, for then we could hope that our prayers would restrain us from shameful and unjust deeds, and that the reward and blessings mentioned in the narrations would be written down for us.

However, detailed familiarity with all these aspects of prayer is unlikely to be achieved by most people nowadays, even many scholars, because of their limiting themselves to a particular _madhhab_. But---as anyone concerned with assisting in compiling and studying the purified Sunnah knows---in every _madhhab_ there are _sunnahs_ which are not found in other _madhhabs_. Moreover, in every _madhhab_ there are sayings and actions which cannot be authentically traced back to the Prophet \pbuh; most of these are found in the sayings of the later scholars,[^a6] many of whom we see firmly attributing these to the Prophet \pbuh![^a7] This is why the _Muḥaddithūn_---may Allāh reward them well---have produced books of _takhrīj_ on the famous books of the later scholars, explaining the rank of each _ḥadīth_ given in them: whether e.g. authentic, weak or fabricated. Examples of these books of _takhrīj_ are: _al-Ināyah fī Maʿrifah Aḥādīth al-Hidāyah_ and _al-Ṭuruq wa al-Wasāʾil fī Takhrīj Aḥadīth Khulāṣah al-Dalāʾil_ by Shaykh ʿAbdul Qādir ibn Muḥammad al-Qurashī al-Ḥanafī; _Nasb al-Rāyah li Aḥādīth al-Hidāyah_ by Ḥāfiẓ Zaylaʾī, and its abridged version _al-Dirāyah_ by Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-ʿAsqalānī, who also wrote _Talkhīs al-Habīr fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al-Rāfiʾī al-Kabīr_; there are many others, naming which will only lengthen this discussion.[^a8]

## Compilation of this book

Since I had not come across a comprehensive book covering this topic, I felt obliged to produce a book which collected together as many features of the Prophet's prayer \pbuh from the _takbīr_ to the _taslīm_ as possible, for the benefit of my Muslim brothers who wished to follow the guidance of their Prophet \pbuh in their worship, such that it would be easy for any who truly loved the Prophet \pbuh to use this book to fulfil his command, “Pray as you have seen me praying.”

Thus I embarked on a difficult task, and researched the relevant _aḥādīth_ from the various sources of _ḥadīth_, the book in your hands being the end result of it all. I stipulated on myself that I would only give _aḥādīth_ which had an authentic _sanad_ according to the principles and regulations of the science of _ḥadīth_. I disregarded any _ḥadīth_ which depended on unknown or weak narrators, whether it dealt with the outward form, _adhkār_, excellence, etc. of the prayer. This is because I hold that the authentic _aḥādīth_[^a9] are sufficient, leaving no need for anything weak, for the latter does not amount to anything except _ẓann_ (conjecture, suspicion), and incorrect conjecture at that; as the Exalted says:

\begin{aquote}{\quran: \najm{} 28}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/53_28}
\end{center}

“...and conjecture is of no use against the truth”
\end{aquote}

<!-- [^a10] -->

and the Prophet \pbuh said, “Beware of suspicion, for truly, suspicion is the most false of speech.”[^a11] Therefore, we cannot worship Allāh by acting according to inauthentic _aḥādīth_; in fact, the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh forbade us from this saying, “Keep away from saying things about me, except what you know”[^a12]; since he has forbidden us from relating weak narrations, it goes without saying that it is forbidden to act according to them.

I have compiled the book as two texts: a main text and a subsidiary text.

The main text includes the text of _aḥādīth_ or phrases taken from them, as well as appropriate words to string them together to give the book a fluency from start to finish. I have been careful to preserve the text of each _ḥadīth_ as it is found in the books of Sunnah; where a _ḥadīth_ has different wordings, I have chosen the version which best fits the fluency etc, but I have brought together other wordings thus: “(in one version: ...)” or “(in one narration: ...)” Only rarely have I given the Companion who narrated the _ḥadīth_, or explained in the main text which of the _Muḥaddithūn_ have collected each _ḥadīth_, in order to provide easy reading and reference.

As for the subsidiary text, it is a commentary on the main text. In it I have traced the _aḥādīth_ to their sources, exploring their various versions and routes of narration. Along with this, I have commented on their _isnād_ and supporting narrations, with authenticating and disparaging remarks on narrators, whether authentic or weak, judged according to the rules of the science of _ḥadīth_. Often, one route of narration has additional words which are not found in other routes, so I have inserted these into the original _ḥadīth_ in the main text whenever it is possible to do so without destroying the fluency, enclosing the addition in square brackets: [...], usually without stating which of the sources were alone in containing that addition. This has been done only if the _ḥadīth_ is originally on the authority of the same Companion, otherwise I have given it separately, e.g. in the opening supplications etc. This insertion of additional wordings is a tremendous advantage which you will not find in many books; Praise be to Allāh, by Whose Favor good actions are completed.

Next, I have mentioned in the subsidiary text the _madhāhib_ of the scholars regarding the _ḥadīth_ traced, as well as the evidence and counter-evidence for each view, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each argument. We have then selected out of that the correct view which we have given in the main text. Also in the subsidiary text, we have given some issues for which there is no text in the Sunnah, but which require _ijtihād_, and do not come under the title of this book.

Since the publication of this book with both main and subsidiary texts is not feasible right now due to various reasons, we have decided to publish only the main text of the book (along with brief footnotes) by Allāh's Will, and named it _Ṣifah Ṣalāh al-Nabī \pbuh, min al-takbīr ilā at-Taslīm Kaʾannaka Tarāhā_ (_The Prophet's Prayer Described, from beginning to end, as though you were watching it_).

I ask Allāh to make this work sincerely for His Face, and to help my brothers in faith to benefit from it, for He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

## Methodology of this book

Since the purpose of this book is to convey the guidance of the Prophet \pbuh regarding prayer, it was elementary that I would not limit myself to a particular _madhhab_, for the reasons mentioned previously. Therefore, I would give whatever is authentically proved from him \pbuh, as has always been the way of the _Muḥaddithīn_,[^a13] whether of old or of the recent past,[^a14] as the excellent saying goes:

> The People of _Ḥadīth_ are the People of the Messenger, although they accompany him not, they are with his every movement.[^a15]

Thus this book would, Allāh Willing, gather whatever is relevant to each topic from the various contents of the books of _ḥadīth_ and the books on the differences between the _madhāhib_, such that the correct verdicts found in this book would not be found totally in any one _madhhab_. Hence the one acting on it, Allāh Willing, would be among those whom Allāh had guided “by His Grace to the Truth concerning that in which they differed, for Allāh guides whom He will to a path that is straight.”[^a16]

When I adopted these principles for myself, i.e. to adhere to the authentic Sunnah, and to implement them in this book as well as others, I knew for sure that this would not satisfy every group of people or sect; in fact, it would result in some, if not most of them, insulting or criticizing me. This does not matter to me, for I also know that to please everyone is an unattainable notion, and that “He who pleases the people by angering Allāh, Allāh will entrust him to the people,” as the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said.[^a17] The reward is with Allāh for the author of the following lines:

> Nor could I ever escape from abuse, Even were I in a cave in a rugged mountain; For who can escape from the people unharmed, Even if he hides behind the eagle's wings?

It is enough for me that I believe that this is the most upright way, which Allāh has commanded the believers to take; which our Prophet Muḥammad \pbuh, Chief of the Messengers, has explained. This is the path which was trodden by the Pious Predecessors: the Companions, their Successors and those after them, including the four Imāms to whose _madhāhib_ the majority of Muslims today attribute themselves. All of them were agreed on the obligation to stick to the Sunnah and to refer to it; to ignore every view contradictory to it, no matter how great the holder or propounder of that view, for the status of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh is far greater, and his example is far truer. Because of this, I have acted on their guidance, followed in their footsteps and carried out their commands to stick to the authentic _ḥadīth_, even if this opposes their view. These commands of theirs have influenced me greatly in my perusal of this path, and my rejection of blind _taqlīd_ (following of opinion). I ask Allāh the Exalted to reward them greatly.

## Sayings of the Imāms regarding following the Sunnah and ignoring their views contradictory to it

It would be beneficial if we gave some of these here, for perhaps this will admonish or remind those who follow the opinion of the Imāms---nay, of those far below the Imāms in rank---blindly,[^a18] sticking to their _madhahībs_ or views as if these had descended from the heavens! But Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, says:

\begin{aquote}{\quran: \araaf{} 3}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/7_3}
\end{center}

“Follow (O men!) the revelation given to you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends and protectors, other than Him. Little is it you remember of admonition.”
\end{aquote}

<!-- [^a19] -->

### Abū Ḥanīfah

The first of them is Abū Ḥanīfah Nuʿmān ibn Thābit, whose companions have narrated from him various sayings and diverse warnings, all of them leading to one thing: the obligation to accept the _ḥadīth_, and to give up following the opinions of the Imāms which contradict it:

1. “When a _ḥadīth_ is found to be _ṣaḥīḥ_, then that is my _madhhab_.”[^a20]

2. “It is not permitted[^a21] for anyone to accept our views if they do not know from where we got them.”[^a22]

    In one narration, “It is prohibited[^a23] for someone who does not know my evidence to give verdicts[^a24] on the basis of my words.”

    Another narration adds, “...for we are mortals: we say one thing one day, and take it back the next day.”

    In another narration, “Woe to you, O Yaʿqūb![^a25] Do not write down everything you hear from me, for it happens that I hold one opinion today and reject it tomorrow, or hold one opinion tomorrow and reject it the day after tomorrow.”[^a26]

3. “When I say something contradicting the Book of Allāh the Exalted or what is narrated from the Messenger \pbuh, then ignore my saying.”[^a27]

### Mālik ibn Anas

As for Imām Mālik ibn Anas, he said:

1. “Truly I am only a mortal: I make mistakes (sometimes) and I am correct (sometimes). Therefore, look into my opinions: all that agrees with the Book and the Sunnah, accept it; and all that does not agree with the Book and the Sunnah, ignore it.”[^a28]

2. “Everyone after the Prophet \pbuh will have his sayings accepted and rejected---not so the Prophet \pbuh.”[^a29]

3. Ibn Wahb said: “I heard Mālik being asked about cleaning between the toes during ablution. He said, ‘The people do not have to do that.’ I did not approach him until the crowd had lessened, when I said to him, ‘We know of a _sunnah_ about that.’ He said, ‘What is that?’ I said, ‘Layth ibn Saʿd, Ibn Laheeʿah and ʿAmr ibn al-Hārith narrated to us from Yazīd ibn ʿAmr al-Maʿāfirī from Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Hubulī from Mustawrid ibn Shaddād al-Qurashī who said, “I saw the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh rubbing between his toes with his little finger.”’ He said, ‘This _ḥadīth_ is sound; I had not heard of it at all until now.’ Afterwards, I heard him being asked about the same thing, on which he ordered cleaning between the toes.”[^a30]

### Imām al-Shāfiʿī

As for Imām al-Shāfiʿī, the quotations from him are most numerous and beautiful,[^a31] and his followers were the best in sticking to them:

1. “The _sunnahs_ of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh reach, as well as escape from, every one of us. So whenever I voice my opinion, or formulate a principle, where something contrary to my view exists on the authority of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, then the correct view is what the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh has said, and it is my view.”[^a32]

2. “The Muslims are unanimously agreed that if a _sunnah_ of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh is made clear to someone, it is not permitted[^a33] for him to leave it for the saying of anyone else.”[^a34]

3. “If you find in my writings something different to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, then speak on the basis of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, and leave what I have said.”

    In one narration: “...then follow it (the Sunnah), and do not look sideways at anyone else's saying.”[^a35]

4. “When a _ḥadīth_ is found to be _ṣaḥīḥ_, then that is my _madhhab_.”[^a36]

5. “You[^a37] are more knowledgeable about _ḥadīth_ than I, so when a _ḥadīth_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_, inform me of it, whether it is from Kufa, Basra or Syria, so that I may take the view of the _ḥadīth_, as long as it is _ṣaḥīḥ_.”[^a38]

6. “In every issue where the people of narration find a report from the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ which is contrary to what I have said, then I take my saying back, whether during my life or after my death.”[^a39]

7. “If you see me saying something, and contrary to it is authentically reported from the Prophet \pbuh, then know that my intelligence has departed.”[^a40]

8. “For everything I say, if there is something authentic from the Prophet \pbuh contrary to my saying, then the _ḥadīth_ of the Prophet \pbuh comes first, so do not follow my opinion.”[^a41]

9. “Every statement on the authority of the Prophet \pbuh is also my view, even if you do not hear it from me.”[^a42]

### Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal

Imām Aḥmad was the foremost among the Imāms in collecting the Sunnah and sticking to it, so much so that he even “disliked that a book consisting of deductions and opinions be written.”[^a43] Because of this he said:

1. “Do not follow my opinion; neither follow the opinion of Mālik, nor al-Shāfiʿī, nor Awzāʾī, nor Thawrī, but take from where they took.”[^a44]

    In one narration: “Do not copy your _Dīn_ from anyone of these, but whatever comes from the Prophet \pbuh and his Companions, take it; next are their Successors, where a man has a choice.”

    Once he said: “Following[^a45] means that a man follows what comes from the Prophet \pbuh and his Companions; after the Successors, he has a choice.”[^a46]

2. “The opinion of Awzāʾī, the opinion of Mālik, the opinion of Abū Ḥanīfah: all of it is opinion, and it is all equal in my eyes. However, the proof is in the narrations (from the Prophet \pbuh and his Companions).”[^a47]

3. “Whoever rejects a statement of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh is on the brink of destruction.”[^a48]

These are the clear, lucid sayings of the Imāms about sticking to the _aḥādīth_ and forbidding the following of their opinion without clear-cut evidence, such that mere opinion and interpretation is not acceptable.

Hence, whoever adhered to whatever of the Sunnah that was proved authentic, even if it opposed some of the Imāms' sayings, he would not be conflicting with their _madhhab_, nor straying from their path; rather, such a person would be following all of them and would be grasping the most trustworthy hand-hold, which never breaks. However, this would not be the case with the one who abandoned any of the authentic Sunnah simply because it contradicted their views; nay, such a person would be being disobedient to them and opposing their above mentioned sayings, while Allāh says:

\begin{aquote}{\quran: \nisaa{} 65}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/4_65}
\end{center}

“But no, by Your Lord, they can have no (real) faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.”
\end{aquote}

<!-- [^a49] -->

He also says:

\begin{aquote}{\quran: \nuur{} 63}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale = \ayahSize]{images/24_63}
\end{center}

“Then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's  order, lest some trial befall them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.”
\end{aquote}

<!-- [^a50] -->

Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī says:

> Therefore it is obligatory on anyone who hears of a command of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh or knows it, to explain it to the _Ummah_, advise them sincerely, and order them to follow his command, even if it contradicts the opinion of someone great. This is because the authority of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh has the most right to be respected and followed, over and above the opinion of anyone great who has unknowingly contradicted the Messenger's command in any matter. This is why the Companions and those after would refute anyone who contradicted the authentic Sunnah, sometimes being very stern in their refutation,[^a51] not out of hatred for that person, for they loved and respected him, but because the Messenger of Allāh was more beloved to them, and his command was superior to the command of any other created being. Hence, when the order of the Messenger and that of someone else conflicted, the order of the Messenger would be more fitting to be enforced and followed. None of this would stop them respecting the person they had opposed because they knew that he would be forgiven;[^a52] in fact, the latter would not mind his instruction being opposed when the command of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh was clearly shown to be opposite.[^a53]

Indeed, how could they mind that, when they had ordered their followers to do so, as we have seen, and had enjoined on them to abandon any of their views which contradicted the Sunnah. In fact, Imām al-Shāfiʿī told his companions to attribute the authentic Sunnah to him also, even if he had not adopted it or had adopted something contradictory to it. Hence, when the analyst Ibn Daqīq al-ʿEid collected together, in a bulky volume, the issues in which one or more of the four Imāms' _madhāhib_ had contradicted the authentic _ḥadīth_, he wrote at the beginning of it, “It is prohibited to attribute these answers to the _Mujtahid Imāms_, and obligatory on the jurists who follow their opinions to know of these so that they do not quote them regarding these and thus lie against them.”[^a54]

### The Imāms' followers leaving their views if these contradicted the Sunnah

Due to all that we have mentioned, the disciples of the Imāms, a number of people from those of old, and a few from those of later time,[^a55] would not accept all of their Imām's views; they actually ignored many when they found them to be clearly against the Sunnah. Even the two Imāms, Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan and Abū Yūsuf differed from their Shaykh, Abū Ḥanīfah “in about a third of the _Madhhab_,”[^a56] as the books of _masāʾil_ prove. Similarly is said about Imām al-Muzanī[^a57] and other followers of al-Shāfiʿī and other _Imāms_; were we to start giving examples, the discussion would become exceedingly, long, and we would digress from what we set out to do in this _Introduction_, so we shall limit ourselves to two instances:

1. Imām Muḥammad says in his _Muwaṭṭā_[^a58](p. 158), “As for Abū Ḥanīfah, he did not regard there being a prayer to ask for rain, but we hold that the Imam prays two _rakʿahs_ and then supplicates and holds out his wrapping garment...”

2. We have ʾIsām ibn Yūsuf al-Balkhī, one of the companions of Imām Muḥammad[^a59] and a servant of Imām Abū Yūsuf,[^a60] who “would give verdicts contrary to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah because he did not know the latter's evidence, and other evidence would present itself to him, so he would give verdicts using that.”[^a61] Hence, “he would raise his hands on bowing (in prayer) and on rising from it,”[^a62] as is the _mutawātir sunnah_ of the Prophet \pbuh; the fact that his three _Imāms_ (i.e. Abū Ḥanīfah, Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad) said otherwise did not prevent him from practicing this _sunnah_. This is the approach which every Muslim is obliged to have, as we have already seen from the testimony of the Four _Imāms_, and others.

To sum up: I sincerely hope that no follower of an _Imām_ will race to condemn the principles of this book and abandon benefiting from the _sunnahs_ of the Prophet \pbuh which it contains, with the argument that they are contrary to his _madhhab_. I hope that such a person will instead consider what we have given of the exhortations of the _Imāms_ towards the obligation to act on the Sunnah and ignore their sayings contradictory to it. I hope also that he will realize that to condemn the attitude of this book is to condemn whichever _Imām_ he is following, for we have taken these principles from those _Imāms_, as we have explained. Therefore, whoever refuses to be guided by them on this path is in great danger, for such refusal necessitates turning away from the Sunnah, the Sunnah to which we have been ordered to refer in cases of difference of opinion and on which we have been commanded to depend.

I ask Allāh to make us among those about whom He says,

> The answer of the believers, when summoned to Allāh and His Messenger, in order that he may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, “We hear and we obey” – it is such as these that will attain Success. It is those who obey Allāh and His Messenger, and fear Allāh, and keep their duty to Him, who will triumph.[^a63]
