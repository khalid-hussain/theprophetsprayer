[^a3]: Al-Bukhārī and Aḥmad.

[^a4]: Mālik, Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasā'ī, and Ibn Ḥibbān. A _ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth_, declared _ṣaḥīḥ_ by several _Imāms_. I have given its _takhrīj_ in _Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd_ (#451, #1276).

[^a5]: _Ṣaḥīḥ_---collected by Ibn al-Mubārak in _al-Zuhd_ (10/21/1--2), Abū Dāwūd and al-Nasāʾī with a good _sanad_; I have given its _takhrīj_ in _Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd_ (#761).

[^a6]: Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Lucknāwī says in _al-Nāfiʿ al-Kabīr liman yutāliʿ al-Jāmiʿ al-Saghīr_ (p.\ 122--3), after ranking the books of _Ḥanafī_ fiqh and saying which of them are dependable and which are not: “All that we have said about the relative grades of these compilations is related to their content of _fiqh_ issues; however, as for their content with regards to _aḥādīth_ of the Prophet \pbuh, then it does not apply, for many books on which the cream of the _fuqahā_ rely are full of fabricated _aḥādīth_, let alone rulings of the scholars. It is clear to us from a broad analysis that although their authors were otherwise competent, they were careless in their quotation of narrations.”

    One of these false, fabricated _aḥādīth_ which are found in some of the best books is: “He who offers the compulsory prayers on the last Friday of _Ramaḍān_, that will make up for every prayer he missed during his life up to the age of seventy years!” al-Lucknāwī says in _al-Āthār al-Marfūʿah fi al-Akhbār al-Mawḍūʿah_ (p.\ 315), after giving this _ḥadīth_, “ʿAlī al-Qārī says in his _al-Mawḍūʿāt al-Ṣughrāh_ and _al-Kubrā_: this is totally false, for it contradicts the _ijmāʿ_ (consensus) that one act of worship cannot make up for those missed over years. Hence, there is no point in quoting the author of _al-Nihāyah_ nor the rest of the commentators on _al-Hidāyah_, for they are not scholars of _ḥadīth_, nor did they reference this _ḥadīth_ to any of the collectors of _ḥadīth_.”

    Imām al-Shawkānī also mentioned this ḥadīth in _al-Fawāʾid al-Majmūʿah fi al-Aḥādīth al-Mawḍūʿah_ with a similar wording and then said (p.\ 54), “This is fabricated beyond doubt---I do not even find it in any of the compilations of fabricated _aḥādīth_! However, it has become popular among some students of _fiqh_ in the city of Ṣanʿāʾ in this age of ours, and many of them have started acting according to it. I do not know who has fabricated it for them---May Allāh disgrace the liars.”

    Al-Lucknāwī further says, “To establish that this _ḥadīth_, which is found in books of rituals and formulas, is fabricated, I have composed a brief essay, with intellectual and narrated evidence, called _Repelling the Brethren from the Inventions of the Last Friday of Ramaḍān_, in which I have filed points which will enlighten minds and to which ears will hearken, so consult it, for it is valuable in this topic and of high quality.”

    The occurrence of similar false _aḥādīth_ in the books of _fiqh_ destroys the reliability of other _aḥādīth_ which they do not quote from dependable books of _ḥadīth_. The words of ʿAlī al-Qārī contain an indication towards this: a Muslim must take _aḥādīth_ from the people who are experts in that field, as the old Arabic sayings go, “The people of Makkah know its mountain paths best” and “The owner of the house knows best what is in it.”

[^a7]: Imām al-Nawawī's words in _al-Majmūʿ Sharḥ al-Muhadhdhab_ (1/60) can be summed up as follows: “The researching scholars of _Ahl al-ḥadīth_ and others say that if the _ḥadīth_ is weak, it will not be said regarding it, ‘The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh said, did, commanded, forbade,’ or any other phrase designating certainty, but instead it will be said, ‘It is reported, quoted, narrated from him,’ or other phrases suggesting uncertainty. They say that phrases of certainty are for _ṣaḥīḥ_ and _ḥasan aḥādīth_, and phrases of uncertainty are for anything else. This is because phrases designating certainty mean that what follows is authentic, so they can only be used in the case of what is authentic, otherwise one would effectively be lying about him \pbuh.

    This convention is one ignored by most of the _fuqahā_ of our age, in fact, by most scholars of any discipline, except for the skilled _muḥaddithīn_. This is disgusting carelessness, for they often say about a _ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth_, ‘It is reported from him that...,’ and about a _ḍaʿīf_ one, ‘he said’ and ‘so- and-so reported...,’ and this is far from correct.”

[^a8]: Publisher's note: Also in this category are the works of our teacher, author of _Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl fi takhrīj Manār al-Sabīl_ in 8 volumes, and _Ghāyah al-Marām fi takhrīj aḥādīth al-Ḥalāl wa al-Harām_, a _takhrīj_ of the _aḥādīth_ found in Dr.\ Yūsuf al-Qaraḍāwi's, _The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam_ (which contains many _ḍaʿīf aḥādīth_).

[^a9]: The term “_authentic ḥadīth_” includes _ṣaḥīḥ_ and _ḥasan_ in the eyes of the _muḥaddithīn_, whether the _ḥadīth_ is _ṣaḥīḥ li dhātihī_ or _ṣaḥīḥ li ghayrihī_, or _ḥasan li dhātihī_ or _ḥasan li ghayrihī_.

[^a11]: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim.

[^a12]: _Ṣaḥīḥ_---collected by al-Tirmidhī, Aḥmad and Ibn Abī Shaybah.

    Later, I discovered that this _ḥadīth_ is actually _ḍaʿīf_: I had relied on Manāwī in declaring _ṣaḥīḥ_ the _isnād_ of Ibn Abī Shaybah, but then I happened to come across it myself, and found that it was clearly weak, being the same _isnād_ as al-Tirmidhī and others -– see my book _Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah_ (1783). However, its place is taken by the Prophet's \pbuh saying, “He who relates from me a saying which he knows is a lie is indeed one of the liars,” collected by Muslim and others.

[^a13]: ʿAbd al-Ḥayy al-Lucknāwī says in _Imām al-Kalām fīmā yataʿallaq bi al-Qirāʾah Khalf al-Imām_ (p.\ 156), as follows: “Whoever dives into the oceans of _fiqh_ and the fundamentals of jurisprudence with an open mind, and does not allow himself to be prejudiced, will know with certainty that in most of the principal and subsidiary issues in which the scholars have differed, the _madhhab_ of the _Muḥaddithīn_ is firmer than other _madhāhib_. Every time I go into the branches of difference of opinion, I find the view of the _Muḥaddithīn_ nearest to justice –- their reward is with Allāh, and He will thank them. How could it be otherwise, when they are the true inheritors of the Prophet \pbuh, and the sincere agents of his Law; may Allāh include us in their company and make us die loving them.”

[^a14]: Al-Subkī says in _al-Fatāwā_ (1/148): “The most important affair of the Muslims is the prayer, which every Muslim must care about and ensure its performance and the establishment of its essentials. Related to prayer are issues on which there is consensus and there is no escaping the truth, and other issues in which the scholars have differed. The correct approach is either to keep clear of dispute if possible, or to look for what is authentically proven from the Prophet \pbuh and adhere to that. When one does this, his prayer will be correct and righteous, and included in the words of the Exalted, “So whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work correct, righteous deeds.” (Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:110)

    I say: The latter approach is superior, nay, obligatory; this is because the former approach, as well as being impossible for many issues, does not fulfill his command \pbuh, “Pray as you have seen me praying,” but instead leads to one's prayer being decidedly different to that of the Prophet \pbuh.

[^a18]: This is the sort of _taqlīd_ (blind following) which Imām al-Ṭaḥāwī was referring to when he said, “Only someone with party-spirit or a fool blindly follows opinion”---quoted by Ibn ʿĀbidīn in _Rasm al-Muftī_ (vol.\ 1, p.\ 32 from the _Compilation of the Essays of Ibn ʿĀbidīn_).

[^a20]: Ibn ʿĀbidīn in _al-Ḥāshiyah_ (1/63), and in his essay _Rasm al-Muftī_ (1/4 from the _Compilation of the Essays of Ibn ʿĀbidīn_), Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Fullānī in _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 62) and others. Ibn ʿĀbidīn quoted from _Sharḥ al-Hidāyah_ by Ibn al-Shaḥnah al-Kabīr, the teacher of Ibn al-Humām, as follows:

    “When a _ḥadīth_ contrary to the _Madhhab_ is found to be _ṣaḥīḥ_, one should act on the _ḥadīth_, and make that his _madhhab_. Acting on the _ḥadīth_ will not invalidate the follower's being a _Ḥanafī_, for it is authentically reported that Abū Ḥanīfah said, ‘When a _ḥadīth_ is found to be _ṣaḥīḥ_, then that is my _madhhab_,’ and this has been related by Imām Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr from Abū Ḥanīfah and from other _Imāms_.”

    This is part of the completeness of the knowledge and piety of the _Imāms_, for they indicated by saying this that they were not versed in the whole of the Sunnah, and _Imām_ al-Shāfiʿī has elucidated this thoroughly (see later). It would happen that they would contradict a _sunnah_ because they were unaware of it, so they commanded us to stick to the Sunnah and regard it as part of their _Madhhab_. May Allāh shower His mercy on them all.

[^a21]: Arabic: _ḥalāl_.

[^a22]: Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr in _al-Intiqāʾ fi Faḍāʾil al-Aʾimmah al-Thalāthah  al-Fuqahā_ (p.\ 145), Ibn al-Qayyim in _Iʿlām al-Muwaqqʿīn_ (2/309), Ibn ʿĀbidīn in his footnotes on _al-Baḥr al-Rāʾiq_ (6/293) and in _Rasm al-Muftī_ (pp.\ 29 and 32) and al-Shaʿrānī in _al-Mīzān al-Kubrā_ (1/55) with the second narration. The last narration was collected by ʿAbbās al-Dawrī in _al-Tārīkh_ by Ibn Maʿīn (6/77/1) with a _ṣaḥīḥ sanad_ on the authority of Zafar, the student of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah. Similar narrations exist on the authority of Abū Ḥanīfah's companions: Zafar, Abū Yūsuf and ʿĀfiyah ibn Yazīd; cf. _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 52). Ibn al-Qayyim firmly certified its authenticity on the authority of Abū Yūsuf in _Iʿlām al-Muwaqqʿīn_ (2/344). The addition to the second narration is referenced by the editor of _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 65) to Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr, Ibn al-Qayyim and others.

    If this is what they say of someone who does not know their evidence, what would be their response to one who knows that the evidence contradicts their saying, but still gives verdicts opposed to the evidence?! Therefore, reflect on this saying, for it alone is enough to smash blind following of opinion; that is why one of the _muqallid shaykhs_, when I criticized his giving a verdict using Abū Ḥanīfah's words without knowing the evidence, refused to believe that it was a saying of Abū Ḥanīfah!

[^a23]: Arabic: _ḥarām_.

[^a24]: Arabic: _fatwā_.

[^a25]: i.e. Imām Abū Ḥanīfah's illustrious student, Abū Yūsuf.

[^a26]: This was because the _Imām_ would often base his view on _qiyās_ (analogy), after which a more potent analogy would occur to him, or a _ḥadīth_ of the Prophet \pbuh would reach him, so he would accept that and ignore his previous view. Al-Shaʿrānī's words in _al-Mīzān al-Kubrā_ (1/62) are summarized as follows:

    “Our belief, as well as that of every researcher into _Imām_ Abū Ḥanīfah, is that, had he lived until the recording of the Sharīʿah, and the journeys of the Preservers of _Ḥadīth_ to the various cities and frontiers in order to collect and acquire it, he would have accepted it and ignored all the analogies he had employed. The amount of _qiyās_ in his _madhhab_ would have been just as little as that in other _madhāhib_, but since the evidences of the Sharīʿah had been scattered with the Successors and their successors, and had not been collected in his lifetime, it was necessary that there be a lot of _qiyās_ in his _madhhab_ compared to that of other _Imāms_. The later scholars then made their journeys to find and collect _aḥādīth_ from the various cities and towns and wrote them down; hence, some _aḥādīth_ of the Sharīʿah explained others. This is the reason behind the large amount of _qiyās_ in his _madhhab_, whereas there was little of it in other _madhāhib_.”

    Abū al-Ḥasanāt al-Lucknāwī quoted his words in full in _al-Nāfiʿ al-Kabīr_ (p.\ 135), endorsing and expanding on it in his footnotes, so whoever wishes to consult it should do so there.

    Since this is the justification for why Abū Ḥanīfah has sometimes unintentionally contradicted the authentic _aḥādīth_---and it is a perfectly acceptable reason, for Allāh does not burden a soul with more than it can bear---it is not permissible to insult him for it, as some ignorant people have done. In fact, it is obligatory to respect him, for he is one of the _Imāms_ of the Muslims through whom this _Dīn_ has been preserved and handed down to us, in all its branches; also, for he is rewarded under any circumstance: whether he is correct or wrong. Nor is it permissible for his devotees to continue sticking to those of his statements which contradict the authentic _aḥādīth_, for those statements are effectively not part of his _madhhab_, as the above sayings show. Hence, these are two extremes, and the truth lies in between. «Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith; and leave not, in our hearts, any rancor against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.» (Sūrah al-Ḥashr, 59:10)

[^a27]: Al-Fullāni in _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 50), tracing it to _Imām_ Muḥammad and then saying, “This does not apply to the _mujtahid_, for he is not bound to their views anyway, but it applies to the _muqallid_.”

    Al-Shaʿrānī expanded on that in _al-Mīzān al-Kubrā_ (1/26): “If it is said: ‘What should I do with the _aḥādīth_ which my _Imām_ did not use, and which were found to be authentic after his death?’ The answer which is fitting for you is: ‘That you act on them, for had your _Imām_ come across them and found them to be authentic, he would have instructed you to act on them, because all the _Imāms_ were captives in the hand of the Sharīʿah.’ He who does so will have gathered all the good with both his hands, but he who says, ‘I will not act according to a _ḥadīth_ unless my _Imām_ did so,’ he will miss a great amount of benefit, as is the case with many followers of the _Imāms_ of the _Madhāhib_. It would be better for them to act on every _ḥadīth_ found to be authentic after the _Imām's_ time, hence implementing the will of the _Imāms_; for it is our firm belief about the _Imāms_ that had they lived longer and come to know of those _aḥādīth_ which were found authentic after their time, they would have definitely accepted and acted according to them, ignoring any analogies they may have previously made, and any views they may have previously held.”

[^a28]: Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr in _Jāmiʿ Bayān al-ʿIlm_ (2/32), Ibn Ḥazm, quoting from the former in _Usūl al-Aḥkām_ (6/149), and similarly al-Fullānī (p.\ 72).

[^a29]: This is well known among the later scholars to be a saying of Imām Mālik. Ibn ʿAbd al-Hādī declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_ in _Irshād al-Sālik_ (227/1); Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr in _Jāmiʿ Bayān al-ʿIlm_ (2/91) and Ibn Ḥazm in _Usūl al-Aḥkām_ (6/145, 6/179) had narrated it as a saying of al-Ḥakam ibn ʿUtaybah and Mujāhid; Taqi al-Dīn al-Subkī gave it, delighted with its beauty, in _al-Fatāwā_ (1/148) as a saying of Ibn ʿAbbās, and then said: “These words were originally those of Ibn ʿAbbās and Mujāhid, from whom Imām Mālik took them, and he became famous for them.” It seems that Imām Aḥmad then took this saying from them, as Abū Dāwūd has said in _Masāʾil al-Imām Aḥmad_ (p.\ 276): “I heard Aḥmad say, ‘Everyone is accepted and rejected in his opinions, with the exception of the Prophet \pbuh.’”

[^a30]: From the _Introduction_ to _al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʿdīl_ of Ibn Abī Hātim, pp.\ 31--2.

[^a31]: Ibn Ḥazm says in _Usūl al-Aḥkām_ (6/118): "Indeed, all the _fuqahā_ whose opinions are followed were opposed to _taqlīd_, and they forbade their companions from following their opinion blindly. The sternest among them in this regard was _Imām_ al-Shāfiʿī, for he repeatedly emphasized, more than anyone else, following the authentic narrations and accepting whatever the proof dictated; he also made himself innocent of being followed totally, and announced this to those around him. May this benefit him in front of Allāh, and may his reward be of the highest, for he was the cause of great good."

[^a32]: Related by al-Ḥākim with a continuous _sanad_ up to _Imām_ al-Shāfiʿī, as in _Tārīkh Dimashq_ of Ibn ʿAsākir (15/1/3), _Iʿlām al-Muwaqqʿīn_ (2/363--364) and _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 100).

[^a36]: Al-Nawawī in _al-Majmūʿ_ (1/63), al-Shaʿrānī (1/57), giving its sources as al-Ḥākim and al-Bayhaqī, and al-Fullānī (p.\ 107). Al-Shaʿrānī said, “Ibn Ḥazm said, ‘That is...found to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ by him or by any other _Imām_.’” His saying given next confirms this understanding.

    Al-Nawawī says: “Our companions acted according to this in the matter of _tathwīb_ (calling to prayer in addition to the _adhān_), the conditions on coming out of _iḥrām_ due to illness, and other issues well-known in the books of the _Madhhab_. Among those of our companions who are reported to have passed judgment on the basis of the _ḥadīth_ (i.e. rather than the saying of al-Shāfiʿī) are Abū Yaʿqūb al-Buwītī and Abū al-Qāsim al-Dārikī. Of our companions from the _Muḥaddithīn_, Imām Abū Bakr al-Bayhaqī and others employed this approach. Many of our earliest companions, if they faced an issue for which there was a _ḥadīth_, and the _madhhab_ of al-Shāfiʿī was contrary to it, would act according to the _ḥadīth_ and give verdicts based on it, saying, ‘The _madhhab_ of al-Shāfiʿī is whatever agrees with the _ḥadīth_.’ Shaykh Abū ʿAmr (Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ) says, ‘Whoever among the al-Shāfiʿīs found a _ḥadīth_ contradicting his _Madhhab_, he would consider whether he fulfilled the conditions of _ijtihād_ generally, or in that particular topic or issue, in which case he would be free to act on the _ḥadīth_; if not, but nevertheless he found it hard to contradict the _ḥadīth_ after further analysis, he would not be able to find a convincing justification for opposing the _ḥadīth_. Hence, it would be left for him to act according to the _ḥadīth_ if an independent _Imām_ other than _Imām_ al-Shāfiʿī had acted on it, and this would be justification for his leaving the _Madhhab_ of his _Imām_ in that issue.’ What he (Abū ʿAmr) has said is correct and established. Allāh knows best.”

    There is another possibility which Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ forgot to mention: what would one do if he did not find anyone else who acted according to the _ḥadīth_? This has been answered by Taqī al-Dīn al-Subkī in his article, _The Meaning of al-Shāfiʿī's saying, “When a _ḥadīth_ is found to be ṣaḥīḥ, then that is my madhhab”_ (p.\ 102, vol.\ 3): “For me, the best thing is to follow the _ḥadīth_. A person should imagine himself in front of the Prophet \pbuh, just having heard it from him: would there be leeway for him to delay acting on it? No, by Allāh...and everyone bears a responsibility according to his understanding.”

    The rest of this discussion is given and analyzed in _Iʿlām al-Muwaqqiʿīn_ (2/302, 370) and in the book of al-Fullānī, _Īqāẓ Himam ūlu al-Abṣār, li al-Iqtidāʾ bi Sayyid al-Muhājirīn wa al-Anṣār, wa Taḥdhīruhum ʿan al-Ibtidāʿ al-Shāʾiʿ fī al-Qurā wa al-Amṣār, min Taqlīd al-Madhāhib maʿ al-Ḥamiyyah wa al-ʿAṣabiyyah bayn al-Fuqahāʾ al-Aʿṣār (Awakening the Minds of Those who have Perception, towards Following the Leader of the Emigrants and Helpers, and Warning them against the Innovation Widespread among Contemporary Jurists in the Towns and Cities, of following Madhāhīb with Zeal and Party-Spirit)_. The latter is a unique book in its field, which every desirer of truth should study with understanding and reflection.

This is why Ibn al-Qayyim attributed it definitely to him in _Iʿlām al-Muwaqqʿīn_ (2/325), as did al-Fullāni in _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 152) and then said: “Al-Bayhaqī said, ‘This is why he--i.e. al-Shāfiʿī---used _ḥadīth_ so much, because he gathered knowledge from the people of Hijāz, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, and so accepted all that he found to be authentic, without leaning towards or looking at what he had considered out of the _Madhhab_ of the people of his land when the truth was clear to him elsewhere. Some of those before him would limit themselves to what they found in the _Madhhab_ of the people of their land, without attempting to ascertain the authenticity of what opposed it. May Allāh forgive all of us.’”

[^a51]: Even against their fathers and learned men, as al-Ṭaḥāwī in _Sharḥ Maʿānī al-Āthār_ (1/372) and Abū Yaʿlā in his _Musnad_ (3/1317) have related, with an _isnād_ of trustworthy men, from Sālim ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar, who said: “I was sitting with Ibn ʿUmar in the mosque once, when a man from the people of Syria came to him and asked him about continuing the _ʿUmrah_ onto the _Ḥajj_ (known as _Ḥajj al-Tamattuʿ_).” Ibn ʿUmar replied, “It is a good and beautiful thing.” The man said, “But your father (i.e. ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb) used to forbid it!” So he said, “Woe to you! If my father used to forbid something which the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh practiced and commanded, would you accept my father's view, or the order of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh?” He replied, “The order of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh.” He said, “So go away from me.” Aḥmad (no.\ 5700) related similarly, as did al-Tirmidhī (2/82) and declared it _ṣaḥīḥ_.

    Also, Ibn ʿAsākir (7/51/1) related from Ibn Abī Dhiʾb, who said:

    “Saʿd ibn Ibrāhīm (i.e. the son of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAwf) passed judgment on a man on the basis of the opinion of Rabīʿah ibn Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, so I informed him of the saying of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh which was contradictory to the judgment. Saʿd said to Rabīʿah, ‘We have Ibn Abī Dhiʾb, whom I regard to be reliable, narrating from the Prophet \pbuh contrary to what I ruled.’ Rabīʿah said to him, ‘You have made your effort, and your judgment has been passed.’ Saʿd said, ‘Most amazing! I enforce the decree of Saʿd, and not the decree of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh! No, I shall withdraw the decree of Saʿd, son of the mother of Saʿd, and enforce the decree of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh.’ So Saʿd called for the written decree, tore it up and gave a new verdict.”

[^a52]: In fact, he would be rewarded, because of the Prophet's \pbuh saying : “When a judge passes judgment, if he performs _ijtihād_ and rules correctly, he will have two rewards; if he performs _ijtihād_ and rules wrongly, he will have one reward.” (Related by al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and others.)

[^a53]: Quoted in the notes on _Īqāẓ al-Himam_ (p.\ 93)

[^a54]: Al-Fullānī (p.\ 99).

[^a55]: cf. Sūrah al-Wāqiʿah, 56:13--14.

[^a56]: Ibn ʿĀbidīn in _Ḥāshiyah_ (1/62), and al-Lucknāwī gave its source in _al-Nāfiʿ al-Kabīr_ (p.\ 93) as al-Ghazzālī.

[^a57]: He himself says at the beginning of his _Concise Shāfiʿī Fiqh_ (printed in the margin of Imām al-Shāfiʿī's _al-Umm_): “This book is a selection from the knowledge of Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī and from the meanings of his sayings, to aid the understanding of whoever wants it, knowing of his forbidding the following of his, or anyone else's, opinion, so that such a person may carefully look for his _Dīn_ in it.”

[^a58]: In which he has explained his opposing his _Imām_ in about twenty _masāʾil_ (#42, #44, #103, #120, #158, #169, #172, #173, #228, #230, #240, #244, #274, #275, #284, #314, #331, #338, #355, #356)---from _Taʿlīq al-Mumajjid ʿalā Muwaṭṭā Muḥammad (Important Notes on Muḥammad's Muwaṭṭā)_

[^a59]: Ibn ʿĀbidīn mentioned him among them in _Ḥāshiyah_ (1/74) and in _Rasm al-Muftī_ (1/17). Al-Qurashī mentioned him in _al-Jawāhir al-Madiyyah fī Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanafiyyah_ (p.\ 347) and said, “He was a reliable transmitter of _ḥadīth_. He and his brother Ibrāhīm were the two _shaykhs_ of Balakh of their time.”

[^a60]: _Al-Fawāʾid al-Bahiyyah fī Tarājum al-Ḥanafiyyah_ (p.\ 116).

[^a61]: _Al-Baḥr al-Rāʾiq_ (6/93) and _Rasm al-Muftī_ (1/28).

[^a62]: _Al-Fawāʾid al-Bahiyyah_...(p.\ 116); the author then added a useful note:

    “From this can be deduced the falsity of Makhūl's narration from Abū Ḥanīfah: ‘that he who raises his hands during prayer, his prayer is ruined,’ by which Amīr, the scribe of Iṭqānī, was deceived, as has been mentioned under his biography. ʿIṣām ibn Yūsuf, a companion of Abū Yūsuf, used to raise his hands, so if the aforementioned narration had any foundation, Abū Yūsuf and ʿIṣām would have known about it. It can also be deduced that if a _Ḥanafī_ ignored the _madhhab_ of his _Imām_ in an issue due to the strength of the evidence against it, this would not take him outside the ranks of the _Imām's_ followers, but this would in fact be proper _taqlīd_ in the guise of leaving _taqlīd_; do you not see that ʿIṣām ibn Yūsuf left Abū Ḥanīfah's _madhhab_ of not raising the hands, but he is still counted as a _Ḥanafī_? To Allāh I complain of the ignorance of our time, when they insult anyone who does not follow his _Imām_ in an issue because of the strength of evidence against it, and expel him from the fold of that _Imām's_ followers! This is not surprising when those who do this are from the ordinary masses, but it is amazing when it comes from those who imitate men of learning but plod along that path like cattle!”
