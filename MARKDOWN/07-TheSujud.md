# The Sujūd

\minitoc

Next, he \pbuh would say _takbīr_ and go down into _sajdah_,[^e78] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do so, saying to him, “No one's prayer is complete unless...he says: ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him,’ and stands up straight, then says: ‘Allāh is the Greatest,’ and prostrates such that his joints are at rest.”[^e79]

Also, when he \pbuh wanted to perform _sajdah_, he would say _takbīr_, [separate his hands from his sides], and then perform _sajdah_.[^e80] Sometimes, he \pbuh would raise his hands when performing _sajdah_.[^e81]

## Going down into _sajdah_ on the hands

He \pbuh used to place his hands on the ground before his knees.[^e82] He \pbuh used to instruct likewise, saying, “When one of you performs _sajdah_, he should not kneel like a camel, but should place his hands before his knees.”[^e83]

He also used to say, “Verily, the hands prostrate as the face prostrates, so when one of you places his face (on the ground), he should place his hands, and when he raises it, he should raise them.”[^e84]

## The _sajdah_ described

He \pbuh would support himself on his palms [and spread them],[^e85] put his fingers together,[^e86] and point them towards the _qiblah_.[^e87]

Also, he \pbuh would put them (his palms) level with his shoulders,[^e88] and sometimes level with his ears.[^e89] He \pbuh would put his nose and forehead firmly on the ground.[^e90]

He \pbuh said to _the one who prayed badly_, “When you prostrate, then be firm in your prostration;”[^e91] in one narration: “When you prostrate, put your face and hands down firmly, until all of your bones are relaxed in their proper places.”[^e92]

He \pbuh also used to say, “There is no prayer for the one whose nose does not feel as much of the ground as the forehead.”[^e93]

He \pbuh used to put his knees and toes down firmly,[^e94] point with the front of the toes towards the _qiblah_,[^e95] put his heels together,[^e96] keep his feet upright,[^e97] and ordered likewise.[^e98]

Hence, these are the seven limbs on which he \pbuh would prostrate: the (two) palms, the (two) knees, the (two) feet, and the forehead and nose---counting the last two as one limb in prostration, as he \pbuh said: “I have been ordered to prostrate (in one narration: we have been ordered to prostrate) on seven bones: on the forehead...” and he indicated by moving his hand[^e99] around his nose, “...the hands (in one version: the palms), the knees and the toes, and not to tuck up[^e100] the garments and hair.”[^e101]

He \pbuh also used to say, “When a slave prostrates, seven limbs prostrate with him: his face, his palms, his knees, and his feet.”[^e102] He \pbuh said about a man who was praying with his hair tied[^e103] behind him, “His example is surely like that of someone who prays with his hands bound (behind his back).”[^e104] He also said, “That is the saddle of the devil,” i.e. where the devil sits, referring to the knots in the hair.[^e105]

He \pbuh would not rest his forearms on the ground,[^e106] but would raise them above the ground, and keep them away from his sides such that the whiteness of his armpits could be seen from behind,[^e107] and also such that if a small lamb or kid wanted to pass under his arms, it would have been able to do so.[^e108]

He \pbuh would do this to such an extent that one of his Companions \mabpwhim said, “We used to feel sorry for the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh because of the way he kept his hands away from his sides.”[^e109]

He \pbuh used to order likewise, saying, “When you perform _sajdah_, place your palms (on the ground) and raise your elbows,”[^e110] and “Be level in _sujūd_, and none of you should spread his forearms like the spreading of a dog (in one narration: like a dog spreads them).”[^e111] In a separate _ḥadīth_, “None of you should rest arms on the ground the way a dog rests them.”[^e112]

He \pbuh also used to say, “Do not spread your arms [the way a beast of prey does], rest on your palms and keep your upper arms apart, for when you do all that, every one of your limbs prostrates with you.”[^e113]

## The obligation to be at ease in _sujūd_

He \pbuh used to command the completion of _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_, comparing someone not doing so to the hungry man who eats one or two dates, which are of no use to him, and also saying about him, “he is indeed one of the worst thieves among the people.”

He also ruled that the prayer of one who does not straighten his spine fully in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_ is invalid, as has been mentioned under \hyperref[the-rukux16bux2bf]{\textit{Rukūʿ}} and ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to be at ease in his _sujūd_, as mentioned before.

## The _adhkār_ of _sujūd_

He \pbuh would say any one of the following remembrances of Allāh and supplications in this posture.

<!-- TODO Check names of sections, as I've renamed some of the ones that have passed -->

1. \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “How Perfect is my Lord, the Most High,” [three times]{style="font-variant:small-caps;"}.[^e114] Sometimes, he would repeat it more times than that.[^e115] Once, he repeated it so much that his _sujūd_ were nearly as long as his standing, in which he had recited three of the Long Sūrahs: _al-Baqarah_, _al-Nisā_, and _Āl ʿImrān_. That prayer was full of supplication and seeking of forgiveness, as mentioned before under \hyperref[tahajjud-prayer]{\textit{Recitation in Tahajjud Prayer}}.

5. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ سَجَدْتُ، وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ، وَلَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ، [وأَنْتَ رَبِّي،] سَجَدَ وَجْهِي لِلَّذِي خَلَقَهُ وَصَوَّرَهُ، [فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَهُ،] وشَقَّ سَمْعَهُ وَبَصَرَهُ، [فـ]تَبَارَكَ اللهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِيْنَ!\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! For you I have prostrated; in You I have believed; to You I have submitted; [You are my Lord;] my face has prostrated for the One Who created it and shaped it, [shaped it excellently,] then brought forth its hearing and vision: [so] blessed be Allāh, the Best to Create!”[^e119]

6. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي ذَنْبِي كُلَّهُ، دِقَّهُ وَجِلَّهُ، وَأَوَّلَهُ وَآخِرَهُ، وَعَلَانِيَتَهُ وَسِرَّهُ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Forgive me all my sins: the minor and the major, the first and the last, the open and the hidden.”[^e120]

7. \begin{Arabicitem}سَجَدَ لَكَ سَوَادِي وَخَيَالِي، وَآمَنَ بِكَ فُؤَادِي، أَبُوءُ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ، هَذِهِ يَدَيَّ وَمَا جَنَيْتُ عَلَى نَفْسِي.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “My person and my shadow have prostrated to You; my heart has believed in You; I acknowledge Your favors towards me: here are my hands and whatever I have earned against myself.”[^e121]

8.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْجَبَرُوتِ وَالْمَلَكُوتِ وَالْكِبْرِيَاءِ وَالْعَظَمَةِ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “How Perfect is He Who has all Power, Kingdom, Magnificence, and Supremacy,”[^e122] which he would say in night prayer, as with the following ones:

9.  \begin{Arabicitem}سُبْحَانَكَ [اللّٰهُمَّ] وَبِحَمْدِكَ، لا إلٰهَ إلَّا أَنْتَ.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “How perfect You are [O Allāh] and Praised. None has the right to be worshiped except you.”[^e123]

11. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْ فِي قَلْبِي نُوراً، [وَفِي لِسَانِي نُوراً،] وَاجْعَلْ فِي سَمْعِي نُوراً، وَاجْعَلْ فِي بَصَرِي نُوراً، وَاجْعَلْ مِنْ تَحْتِي نُوراً، وَاجْعَلْ مِنْ فَوْقِي نُوراً، وَعَنْ يَمِينِي نُوراً، وَعَنْ يَسَارِي نُوراً، وَاجْعَلْ أَمَامِي نُوراً، وَاجْعَلْ خَلْفِي نُوراً، [وَاجْعَلْ فِي نَفْسِي نُوراً،] وَأَعْظِمْ لِي نُوراً.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! Place light in my heart; [and light in my tongue;] and place light in my hearing; and place light in my seeing; and place light from below me; and place light from above me, and light on my right, and light on my left; and place light ahead of me; and place light behind me; [and place light in my self;] and make the light greater for me.”[^e125]

12. \begin{Arabicitem}

    [اللّٰهُمَّ][إِنِّي] أَعُوذُ بِرِضَاكَ مِنْ سَخَطِكَ، وَ[أَعُوذُ] بِمُعَافَاتِكَ مِنْ عُقُوبَتِكَ، وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْكَ لا أُحْصِي ثَنَاءً عَلَيْكَ أَنْتَ كَمَا أَثْنَيْتَ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ.
    \end{Arabicitem}  
    “[O Allāh!][Indeed] I seek refuge with Your Pleasure from Your Anger; [I seek refuge] with Your Pardons from Your Punishment; I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot count all exaltations upon You; You are as You have extolled Yourself.”[^e126]

## Forbiddance of reciting the Quran in _sujūd_

He \pbuh used to forbid recitation of the Quran in _rukūʿ_ and _sujūd_, and commanded striving in, and a lot of, supplication in this posture, as explained previously under \hyperref[the-rukux16bux2bf]{\textit{Rukūʿ}}. He \pbuh also used to say, “The slave is closest to his Lord when he is prostrating, so increase supplication [in it].”[^e127]

## Lengthening the _sajdah_

He \pbuh would make his _sujūd_ about as long as his _rukūʿ_, and sometimes he would make it extremely long due to the circumstances, as one of his Companions \mabpwhim said:

> The Messenger of Allāh \pbuh came out to us for one of the two later prayers, [_Ẓuhr_ or _ʿAṣr_,] carrying al-Ḥasan or al-Ḥusayn. The Prophet \pbuh then came to the front and put him down [next to his right foot], said _takbīr_ for the prayer and commenced praying. During the prayer, he performed a very long prostration, so I raised my head [from among the people], and there was the child, on the back of the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, who was in prostration. I then returned to my prostration. When the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh had offered the prayer, the people said, “O Messenger of Allāh! In the middle of [this] your prayer, you performed a prostration and lengthened it so much that we thought either something had happened, or that you were receiving revelation!” He \pbuh said, “Neither of these was the case: actually, my son made me his mount, so I did not want to hurry him until he had satisfied his wish.”[^e128]

In another _ḥadīth_, “He \pbuh was praying. When he performed _sajdah_, al-Ḥasan and al-Ḥusayn jumped onto his back. When the people tried to stop them, he gestured to them to leave the two alone. After offering his prayer, he placed them in his lap and said, ‘Whoever loves me should love these two.’”[^e129]

## Excellence of _sajdah_

He \pbuh used to say, “There is no one among my _Ummah_ whom I will not recognize on the Day of Resurrection.” They said, “How will you recognize them, O Messenger of Allāh, among the multitude of created beings?” He said, “Do you not see that were one of you to enter an enclosure in which there was a jet black[^e130] steed and a horse with a white forehead and legs,[^e131] would you not recognize the latter from the former?” They said, “Of course.” He said, “Thus, my _Ummah_ on that day will surely have white faces[^e132] because of _sujūd_, and white arms and feet[^e133] because of ablution.”[^e134]

He would also say, “When Allāh intends to have mercy on whomsoever he wishes of the people of the Fire, He will order the angels to bring out whoever used to worship Allāh; so they will bring them out, recognizing them from the marks of _sujūd_, for Allāh has prohibited the Fire from devouring the marks of _sujūd_. Thus, they will be brought out from the Fire, for the Fire devours all of a son of Ādam except the marks of _sujūd_.”[^e135]

## _Sajdah_ on the ground and on mats[^e136]

He \pbuh would often prostrate on the (bare) ground.[^e137]

His Companions \mabpwthem would pray with him \pbuh in the intense heat, so when one of them could not press his forehead against the ground, he would spread his robe and prostrate on that.[^e138]

He \pbuh also used to say, “The whole earth has been made a _masjid_ (place of worship) and a purification for me and my _Ummah_; so wherever prayer becomes due on someone of my _Ummah_, he has his _masjid_ (place of worship) and his purification next to him. Those before me used to think that this was too much: indeed, they would only pray in their churches and synagogues.”[^e139]

Sometimes, he \pbuh would prostrate in mud and water, and that happened to him once at dawn on the twenty-first night of Ramadan, when it rained and the roof of the mosque, which was made of palm-branches, was washed away. So he \pbuh prostrated in mud and water; Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī \mabpwhim said, “So I saw, with my own eyes, the Messenger of Allāh \pbuh, with traces of mud and water on his forehead and nose.”[^e140]

Also, he \pbuh would pray on a _khumrah_[^e141] sometimes, or on a mat[^e142] sometimes, and he prayed on it once when it had become blackened due to prolonged use.[^e143]

## Rising from _sajdah_

<!-- TODO add iftirash to glossary -->

Next, he \pbuh would raise his head from prostration while saying _takbīr_,[^e144] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do that, saying, “The prayer of any person is not complete until...he prostrates until his limbs are at rest, then he says, ‘Allah is the Greatest’ and raises his head until he is sitting straight.”[^e145] Also, he \pbuh would raise his hands with this _takbīr_ sometimes.[^e146]

## To sit _muftarishan_ between the two _sajdahs_

Next, he \pbuh would lay his left foot along the ground and sit on it [relaxed],[^e146x] and he \pbuh ordered _the one who prayed badly_ thus, saying to him, “When you prostrate, prostrate firmly, then when you rise, sit on your left thigh.”[^e147]

He \pbuh would have his right foot upright,[^e148] and point its toes towards the _qiblah_.[^e149]

## _Iqʿā_ between the two _sajdahs_

He \pbuh would sometimes practice _iqʿā_ [resting on both his heels and (all) his toes].[^e150]

## The obligation of being at ease between the two _sajdahs_

He \pbuh would be relaxed until every bone returned to its (proper) position,[^e151] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ likewise, and said to him, “The prayer of any of you is not complete until he does this.”[^e152]

## Lengthening the sitting between the two _sajdahs_

Also, he \pbuh would lengthen it until it was about almost as long as his _sajdah_,[^e153] and sometimes, he \pbuh would remain (in this position) until one would say: “He has forgotten.”[^e154]

## The _adhkār_ between the two _sajdahs_

In this sitting, he \pbuh would say:

1. \begin{Arabicitem}اللّٰهُمَّ (وَفِي لَفْظٍ: رَبِّ) اغْفِرْ لِي، وَارْحَمْنِي، [وَاجْبُرْنِي،][وَارْفَعْنِي،] وَاهْدِنِي، [وعَافِني،] وَارْزُقْنِي.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O Allāh! (in one version: O my Lord!) Forgive me; have mercy on me; [strengthen me;] [raise my rank;] guide me; [pardon me;] sustain me.”[^e155] Or sometimes, he would say:

2. \begin{Arabicitem}رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي اغْفِرْ لِي.\end{Arabicitem}  
    “O my Lord! Forgive me, forgive me.”[^e156]

He would say the above two in night prayer also.[^e157]

## The second _sajdah_

Next, he \pbuh would say _takbīr_ and prostrate for the second time.[^e158] He also ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do so, saying to him after he had ordered him to be at ease between _sajdahs_, “...then say ‘Allāh is the Greatest’ and prostrate until your joints are relaxed [and do that in all your prayer].”[^e159] He would perform this _sajdah_ exactly as he performed the first one. Also, he \pbuh would raise his hands with this _takbīr_ sometimes.[^e160]

Next, he \pbuh would raise his head while saying _takbīr_,[^e161] and he ordered _the one who prayed badly_ to do likewise, saying to him after ordering him to prostrate for the second time, “...then raise your head and say _takbīr_.”[^e162] He \pbuh also said to him, “[then do that in all your bowings and prostrations,] for if you do that, your prayer will be complete, and if you fall short in any of this, you will be deficient in your prayer.”[^e163] Also, he \pbuh would sometimes raise his hands[^e164] with this _takbīr_.

## The sitting of rest

Next, he \pbuh would sit straight [on his left foot, upright, until every bone returned to its position].[^e165]

## Supporting oneself with the hands on rising for the next _rakʿah_

Next, he \pbuh would get up for the second _rakʿah_, supporting himself on the ground.[^e166] Also, he \pbuh would clench his fists[^e167] during prayer, supporting himself with his hands when getting up.[^e168]
